Get to Know Super Au Pair Finalist Dani!,Since her first interview with the Cassidy family  Dani felt a connection. She’d had other interviews prior  but it didn’t feel the same. “When I was talking with them  I really felt that they were interested in me and my experience as an au pair. I felt they wanted me to enjoy my au pair experience and I really appreciated that ” Dani recalls. Dani also felt the Cassidys were patient with her English during their chats. She felt comfortable talking to them in her non-native language  despite the challenges of using words and grammar she wasn’t used to using on a daily basis. As Dani prepared for her departure from Mexico City to Pennsylvania  the Cassidys sent Dani information about their local city  Philadelphia. Dani’s brother  an avidRockyfan  let her know she was going to be enteringRockyterritory living in Philly. During her first weekend  the Cassidys took Dani to the famousRocky stepsat the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Host dad Brian and au pair Dani ran up the steps humming the Rocky theme song. It was a fun memory and a great way to kick off Dani’s au pair year with the Cassidys.   Dani has loved taking care of now nine-month-old baby boy Hart. Since day one  Hart has shown her how much he’s taken to Dani through his smile. Dani says  “He is warm  just like his parents.” Taking care of a young baby can present its challenges  but Dani has loved watching him grow and change as the months go by. With host mom Kate working from home  Dani and Kate will often talk about Hart’s development and care. It’s usually the topic of conversation during their daily lunch dates at home during Hart’s nap time. “She is a good listener. She gives good advice. I really appreciate that we talk. She asks me how I feel ” Dani says about her host mom. Cultural exchange has been a huge part of Dani’s and the Cassidy’s au pair program experience. Sharing a love for music and literature  Dani and host dad Brian have exchanged ideas about music genres and books. Brian has introduced Dani to new and different kinds of American music and Dani has shared cumbia and salsa music with Brian  typical sounds of Mexico City  where Dani is from. The social and extroverted Cassidys always include Dani in their plans as well  so she never feels left out. This past November  Dani got to experience Thanksgiving for the first time. She appreciated that Americans celebrate a holiday solely dedicated to giving thanks.   The thoughtful Cassidys continue to treat Dani with gratitude and generosity. During their interviews  Dani had shared with them how much she’d always wanted to visit New York. Kate and Brian bought her a ticket  asked some friends if she could stay with them in Brooklyn  and organized a trip for her to visit this long-awaited destination. They also gifted her a flight home to Mexico City for Christmas so she could enjoy the holiday with her natural family. Both Kate and Brian have been to Mexico City multiple times before  and Dani hopes that they’ll return in the future to visit her. “I’m excited to think they will visit me in the future and I can share with them my city.” Congratulations  Dani  on being a 2024Super Au PairFinalist!

Get to Know Au Pair USA’s 2024 Super Au Pair: Carla!,Any au pair would probably feel a little nervous about joining a family withfive kids. But for Carla  a 26-year-old au pair from Mexico  those fears didn’t last long. From the interview process with the Sharkey family in March 2023  Carla knew right away that this would be an incredible match. The conversation flowed nicely. They were funny and positive  and they had so much in common  including skiing  running  and musical theatre.   Joining a “quilted family” as host dad Mike Sharkey puts it  Carla rose to the challenge. Not only had this family blended five children together after the deaths of a biological mom and dad  but they’d only begun living together 20 days prior to Carla’s arrival after Mike and Marisa got married. Carla’s initial nerves of moving abroad and taking care of five kids escaped quickly though  as the Sharkeys made her immediately feel comfortable and welcome. Shortly after settling in  devastation occurred in the form of a house fire. The Sharkeys had just completed a home renovation and moved into their dream house. They were eager to begin this next chapter of their lives as one family unit  Carla included. During dinner one evening  the family heard noises by the chimney  but thought nothing of it. They enjoyed their meal and conversation as usual  laughing and chatting about their day. After dinner  Carla started making lunches for the next day  while some of the kids were getting ready for bed. A neighbor knocked on the door and told them the chimney was on fire! Carla quickly got the kids and dog out of the house. She was the calming force in a time of chaos  running after the Sharkey’s son who wanted to return to the home after evacuating and wiping tears from others who sat filled with fear. Even though Carla was scared too (fire is her biggest fear even before this happened)  she was able to step up as a caregiver and support system to the Sharkey kids during this critical time. Carla credits her ability to be so strong to her host parents  who are a constant positive force no matter what the circumstances. She recalls host dad Mike telling the visibly upset children that night  “If there’s a family that knows how to pivot  it’s us.” The weeks that followed were probably the most challenging for au pair Carla. She was responsible for helping move six people’s belongings into temporary housing. The stress and anxiety of making sure she didn’t forget anything for herself or her host kids was tough. She remembers packing a box for everyone during that week  while the host parents handled all the necessary steps with insurance  a temporary home  etc. “It was around the holidays  so I was feeling pretty down. We did it as a team and as a family  so it went by quickly”  Carla recalls. While the home fire and aftermath may have been a bump in the road  Carla’s au pair experience with the Sharkeys has presented many happy memories and experiences. With all their commonalities  they’ve enjoyed skiing together in the Colorado mountains and running together on Saturday mornings as a family. Host dad Mike has even helped Carla train for two marathons since her arrival in 2023.   Perhaps the most memorable of Carla’s experiences with the Sharkeys  however  has been being present for the cross adoption of the children. In summer 2024  Mike and Marisa cross-adopted each other’s children. “I never thought I’d experience it in the U.S. or anywhere. It was a unique experience”  Carla recalls. “The priest was there and the grandparents. When they made it official and hugged  it was a very sweet moment.”   Carla’s two-year au pair program will be coming to an end in July 2025.  While this departure will certainly be a sad one  Carla and the Sharkeys will most certainly remain family for life. Experiences like a home fire may be hard in the moment  but they also strengthen relationships like no other. “This program is amazing. It gives you the chance to explore and connect  but the Sharkeys have made it a lot more special for me.” Thank you  Carla for sharing your story and for being Au Pair USA’s2024 Super Au Pair!

Understanding American Holiday Culture,This post was originally published in December 2015 and revised by other contributors in December 2024. The holiday season is upon us! Here’s a quick overview of holidays celebrated in the U.S. to to get you acclimated to some of fall’s main celebrations  American style: This holiday gives children the opportunity to dress up in their scariest (or prettiest  or wackiest) outfits  while running around the neighborhood  yelling “trick or treat!” and filling pillowcases with fun-sized chocolates and candies. Take note that many people of all ages celebrateHalloween. Don’t be surprised if almost everyone on your block is handing out candy  if your children wear costumes to a school event  or even if your host parents or you get invited to a Halloween party! However  some families choose not to celebrate Halloween for religious reasons. Be sure you and your host family are on the same page before making jack-o-lanterns with the kids! Thanksgiving  or “Turkey Day” as you may hear it referred to  commemorates a feast shared by both indigenous Americans and early Pilgrims to the New World. This day brings American families together to cook a massive feast  eat it together  view a football game  and to remember to give thanks for the food  family  and other good fortune they have. Many workers are given a day off on both Thursday and Friday. During this holiday  many Americans make the journey back to their hometowns or to the cities where other loved ones live in an effort to share with their family. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics Thanksgiving is the most heavily traveled time of year! While not an official holiday  Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving and is worth mentioning here. It’s the biggest sale day of the year for shopping! Nearly every store offers lower pricing on their products on Black Friday in preparation for gift buyers starting their Christmas  Hanukkah  and Kwanzaa shopping. Be sure to take advantage of some of these deals  but also beware: stores are crowded  lines are long  and high-demand products may sell out quickly. If crowded shopping isn’t your thing  don’t worry. Most stores will offer online savings as well! This eight-day festival of lights commemorates the rededication of the holy Temple in Jerusalem after the reclamation from Greek-Syrian conquerors. Jewish families celebrate Hanukkah by lighting thehanukkiah(usually referred to as amenorah). Each night at sundown  another candle is lit until at the end of the celebration all of the eight candles are glowing (the candle in the middle is used to light the others  so there are nine in total). Families also exchange gifts each evening and share traditional foods such as potato pancakes  calledlatkes  and jelly-filled doughnuts. People of all ages  but especially children  love playingdreideland giving outgelt! While a traditionally Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ  the celebration of Christmas has integrated itself into secular United States culture. Don’t be surprised to see garland  bows  fake snow  bells  Santa  and signs wishing everyone a “Merry Christmas!” or “Happy Holidays!” around your city. There are many Americans who do not celebrate Christmas. If you’re not sure if someone celebrates Christmas or not  it’s good form to tell people “Happy Holidays!” rather than “Merry Christmas!” Christmas is a time for gift-giving and sharing a meal with family. Much like Thanksgiving  this is a big time for travel. Many people do their best to make it “home for Christmas” – even if it is the only time of the year that they see their family. Children will eagerly await the arrival of Santa Claus  who – the story goes – comes down the chimney on Christmas Eve in order to stuff children’s stockings with goodies and leave gifts under the Christmas tree! Kwanzaais a weeklong celebration that honors African heritage in African-American culture. Kwanzaa is observed from December 26th to January 1st  and ends with a celebratory meal and gift exchange. Kwanzaa is a relatively newer holiday than Hanukkah or Christmas  having begun in 1966.There are seven principles  which coordinate with the seven days and seven candles that are lit throughout the week: Umoja (unity)  Kujichagulia (self-determination)  Ujima (collective work and responsibility)  Ujamaa (cooperative economics)  Nia (purpose)  Kuumba (creativity) and Imani (faith). Kwanzaa is not a religious holiday. New Year’s Eve is a night to celebrate the past year and welcome the new one! Depending on your host family’s plans  you may have the night off to hang out with friends  or you might be working so your host parents can enjoy a party or event for adults only  since New Year’s events usually don’t end until after midnight. No matter your plans  it will be a New Year’s Eve to remember—one you spent in the U.S. The holiday season can be a busy time of year  filled with many parties  events  and social gatherings. Whether the holidays you celebrate during your au pair program year are similar to or different from what you’ve experienced before  the holiday season is a wonderful time to experience cultural exchange with new family and friends. Be intentional about participating in these experiences. You’ll create so many wonderful new memories by doing so!

When Cultural Exchange Transforms Family to Famiglia,TheAu Pair USA programis more than just a childcare solution for busy families—it creates opportunities for genuine cultural exchange and lifelong connections. The story of Marianna  a 26-year-old au pair from Puglia  Italy  and her host family demonstrates how this program can transform lives and create bonds that extend far beyond the au pair program’s official duration  which is usually one to two years. Findingthe right host familyis crucial for any au pair’s success. For Marianna  like many others  the prospect of moving to a new country brought considerable anxiety. “Before being an au pair  I was so scared to come to the USA and find a family that wasn’t good ” she recalls. “I was scared to go into a rematch and change (my) family or go back home.” Her host family  consisting of Eleanor  Pierpaolo  their 3-year-old son Elio  and baby Valentino  had their own specific hopes for the program. As Eleanor explains  “We wanted someone to join our family that we could trust and have close to us  and who would be a real part of our family.” With Pierpaolo’s Italian heritage  they specifically sought an Italian au pair who could help maintain their children’s connection to their cultural roots. During the interview process  Marianna stood out immediately. “She was the best!! Mature  interesting  kind  humble and seemed genuinely interested in meeting us and joining our lives ” Eleanor shares. This initial impression grew into a deeper relationship that extended beyond typical host family-au pair bonds. Since Marianna’s arrival in May 2023  she has become an integral part of the family. “I love my host family because they treat me like a real member of the family ” she says. “They respect me  respect my space and my free time. I love that they respect my working hours without ever exceeding them.” This adherence toprogram rules and regulationsis particularly important  as it creates a foundation of mutual respect and trust. Marianna’s relationship with baby Valentino has been very special. Having cared for him since he was just one month old  their connection grew so strong that “Marianna” became his first word! The depth of their connection became clear during a Christmas celebration on December 23rd. During the festivities with extended family  Marianna surprised her host family with a poster asking to extend her stay for another year. Their response wasn’t just an enthusiastic “yes!” And they had a surprise of their own: asking Marianna to become Valentino’s godmother. “I will remember that day for the rest of my life ” Marianna recalls  her voice full of emotion. “We all were happy and crying tears of joy.” This moment transformed their relationship from a temporary childcare arrangement into a permanent family bond. On March 9  2024  both families gathered in Cormons  a town in northern Italy  for Valentino’s baptism. The celebration beautifully merged both families and cultures. Marianna’s family traveled from Puglia  bringing traditional dishes like focaccia  mozzarella  and stracciatella  creating a feast that celebrated both the spiritual occasion and their newfound family connections. The end of Marianna’s au pair program won’t mark the end of their relationship. “I will always be present in Valentino’s life ” she affirms. “I will come back and visit him after my 2 years of au pair  they can come to Italy and visit me ALL THE TIME  WHENEVER THEY WANT.“ Eleanor shares this sentiment with humor: “She’s stuck with us! We’ll bring the boys to visit her in Puglia  and she can come back to visit any time  and when the boys are older we’ll send them to spend summers with her.“ Marianna’s story exemplifies how theAu Pair programcan create lasting impacts beyond its primary goals. While the au pair program is designed to provide childcare while promoting cultural exchange  in cases like Marianna’s  it creates something even more valuable: lifelong family bonds that span continents and cultures. When both host family and au pair approach the experience with openness  respect  and genuine care  the rewards can far exceed expectations  creating connections that last a lifetime.

Thanksgiving Tips for Au Pairs,This post was originally published in November 2021 and was revised by other contributors in November 2024. Experiencing American holidays is one of the best parts of being on the Au Pair cultural exchange program. On the fourth Thursday of November most people in the U.S. celebrateThanksgiving. You’ve probably heard stories or seen movies that showed families celebrating Thanksgiving together. You might be thinking  ‘That food looks strange’ or ‘Why do Americans watch football on this day?’ We want to give you some tips for getting the most out of this ultra-American holiday. Thanksgiving originated in 1621 when the Plymouth colonists (or “Pilgrims”) and the native Wampanoag people shared an feast after a plentiful autumn harvest. [Learn more about the history of Thanksgiving]. Nowadays  Thanksgiving remains a day where families and friends get together to express gratitude. It’s tradition to eat a big meal on Thanksgiving. Here are some things you’ll likely see on the dinner table: turkey  stuffing  cranberry sauce  gravy  mashed potatoes  sweet potatoes  and pumpkin pie just to name a few. The food may look weird and unfamiliar to you  but try it all!  Jacqueline  an au pair from Brazil  said  “At first everything was strange  and I didn’t think I would like anything. But  it became my favorite meal in this country since then.” First  don’t be shy to share your culture.The first Thanksgiving was a celebration of cultural exchange  with the Native Americans teaching the Pilgrims how to hunt and find local fruits like grapes and cranberries. In return  the Pilgrims introduced English crops like cabbage and carrots to the menu. Let that be even more of a reason to add some authentic El Salvadorian pupusas to your host family’s appetizer spread  or a delicious Italian tiramisu to the dessert selection. Jacqueline said  “My host kids love when I make brigadeiro  a typical Brazilian dessert”. You may be asked to share about something you’re grateful for as part of the conversation during dinner. You can probably think of many things this year  especially as an au pair! Many American families watchNFL footballon Thanksgiving Day. The NFL has been playing football games on Thanksgiving Day since 1934. Two teams who almost always play on this day are the Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions. You might also want to tune into the famousMacy’s Thanksgiving Day parade. It’s been a tradition in New York City since 1924 and is broadcast across the country. Ask your host family what channel you can watch the parade on Thanksgiving morning. If you’re close to Manhattan  you may want to go watch it in person! Although not exactly part of Thanksgiving Black Fridayis a big day for sales. It usually begins on Thanksgiving night. Many host parents will have the Friday after Thanksgiving (Black Friday) off from work and they may want to do some holiday shopping. Be sure to ask what your schedule will be on Black Friday before making your shopping plans! Whether you’re celebrating with your host family or new friends  be sure to make it a day to remember. Try new foods  watch new sports  check out the parade  and share what you’re thankful for this year! And remember that Thanksgiving is just the beginning of the holiday season in the USA!

Enjoying the Trip, No Matter What!,When Alexa (26) from Germany joined the Au Pair program  she was excited to match with an incredible host family with three adorable kiddos. After leaving her office job in Germany and arriving in the Seattle Washingtonarea in August 2024  Alexa settled in as a full-time  live-in caregiver to a six-month-old  two- and three-year-old. She soon found her groove as an au pair  managing the two toddlers and a baby. She also quickly made friends with au pairs in the vicinity and began her cultural exchange experience. Being an avid traveler in Europe and having visited many countries like Spain  Italy  Greece  Hungary  Montenegro  Albania  and Israel  Alexa knew she wanted to alsotravelas much as possible during her time in the U.S. So  when her au pair friend  Rika (19)  from South Africa invited her on a spontaneous trip to Chicago one weekend  she couldn’t say no! After clearing her vacation plans with herhost family  Alexa and Rika flew out of Washington on a Thursday night redeye flight  arriving Friday morning in Chicago. What happened next was not in the travel plans though. Rika lost her purse! Having no money or ID while traveling is certainly challenging. Add being in a foreign country to the mix  and it’s even more stressful. Alexa and Rika spent their first hours in Chicago filing a police report and figuring out next steps to navigate the situation. Once they had taken all the necessary steps  they began a fun day in a new city. The off-duty au pairs walked around Chicago  visiting touristy spots likeThe Bean. They took a boat trip and ended their first day with hamburgers in their hotel room. The rest of the trip was filled with exploratory walks and popping into planned places like The Nutella Cafe  where they enjoyed delicious ice cream.  It was a great lesson for me to take things easy  because if you can’t change it  you can still make the best out of the situation you’re in. -Alexa  Alexa and Rika finally boarded their flight home to Washington after an adventure-packed weekend and returned home Sunday morning. Alexa’s host family picked them up from the airport. After doing laundry  showering  and then taking a long nap so she was well rested for work on Monday  Alexa was grateful for the incredible trip she’d been able to experience with her new friend  despite the unfortunate purse incident. We asked what her tips would be for traveling since she has been to so many places  here’s what Alexa had to say: It’s very important to look up some stuff in advance . Know where you want to go  a special restaurant to try or shop to go to. I like to go with the flow  but I am also a little more structured when I visit a new place so I do some research in advance-like on TikTok or Instagram or with some bloggers who have been to this city before. -Alexa Watch your stuff so you don’t lose anything. Enjoy your time even if you do lose it though. Time is too short to be sad or mad about the things you can’t change. -Alexa We’re glad you had a great trip  Alexa and Rika!

Au Pair Educational Course Requirements Frequently Asked Questions,This post was originally published in April 2019 and revised in September 2024 by other contributors. As part of theU.S. Department of State’s Au Pair Program regulations  au pairs are required to complete at least six semester hours of credit at anaccreditedpost-secondary institution during their program year. This educational requirement provides a fantastic way for you to pursue your educational interests  meet new people  and experience an important aspect of American culture. Host families are required to give au pairs up to$500 towards these educational classes per program year. Here are some frequently asked questions about the au pair education requirement. This information is also in the Au Pair USAAu Pair Handbook. Your Local Coordinator will have advice about eligible classes in your area. Six credits over the course of the au pair program year are required. A typical college-level class earns 3 credits and lasts several months  so it is important to get started finding a class right away. If the class you want to take is at an accredited post-secondary institute but it doesn’t offer credit  you may be able to count the number of hours of class time toward your requirement.. Each 30-hour class is equal to 3 credits  so you’ll likely need to take two classes to complete your au pair educational requirement. As with any other classes  be sure to submit aClass Pre-Approval Formbefore enrolling. Classes must be on the campus of and/or be associated with an accredited post-secondary institution  which is generally a college or university. Keep in mind that library  community center  and church-based classes typically are not accepted unless they are affiliated with an accredited  post-secondary institution. Sometimes classes can be taken virtually as well. Always check that the course you plan to take is through an accredited  post-secondary institution. You should always submit aClass Pre-Approval Formto Au Pair USA before enrolling or paying for a class. Au Pair USA reviews the forms  and will let you know if the course will be approved and how many credits you will receive. Sooner is better! Au Pair USA recommends researching the types of classes you are interested in taking as soon as you’ve matched with a host family. This will give you enough time to discuss the schedule with your host family and get thePre-Approvalprocess started. Keep in mind that most academic terms have specific start dates (often in August and January)  so be sure you have enough time to enroll before the start date. Most classes that earn academic credit at an accredited post-secondary institution are accepted. Classes that earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs) rather than academic credits (typically part of a university Continuing Education Program or Adult Education Program)) should have an academic focus such as language  marketing  history  science  psychology  English as a Second language  and so on. Make sure you getPre-Approvalfor all classes. In general  these classes are not acceptable unless they have a strong academic component and earn credits (not CEUs) at an accredited university. In general  if these classes are held at an accredited academic university  they will be approved. The most important thing to do is submit aClass Pre-Approval Form. Your Local Coordinator can also help you find appropriate course options and answer your questions. Check yourAu Pair USA Passport profileas some pre-approved classes may be listed there as well. Your host family may also be able to help you with local options  especially if they have hosted au pairs before. Weekend au pair courses which earn three credits from an accredited university provide you with an opportunity to earn credit quickly. This is especially useful if you are not able to complete a longer course due to time constraints. However  there are many different class operators and you will still need to make sure that the class you want to take is acceptable to Au Pair USA and affiliated with an accredited university. These classes are generally more expensive than local options because the au pair must pay for travel  food  and lodging in addition to the class’s tuition cost. Remember that au pairs have a $500 educational allowance provided by their host family for their 12-month program to complete the 6 credit hours. Au Pair USA does not accept courses that earn 6 credits in one weekend unless they involve 60 hours of classroom time. Some courses advertise that they will fulfill 60 hours worth of educational hours. However  when looking at the class schedule  only 30 hours are with an instructor learning in an educational environment  and the other 30 hours are assignments before and after. In this case  Au Pair USA would only be able to count the 30 hours of class time. If you are going home after the12-monthprogram is over  your education must be completed before your program end date. If you plan to extend your program  you have to complete the educational requirement before you can submit the extension application  which is no later than45days before your scheduled program end date. Au Pair USA recommends planning early! We cannot submit your extension request to the U.S. Department of State without your completed education component. When the course is finished  au pairs must obtain a school document as proof that they completed the class. This might be a letter  certificate  or transcript from the school. Au pairs then upload those documents to the “End of Year” tab inPassport. You must complete and upload these documents in order to successfully conclude the program. Host parents support au pairs in three ways: Yes. If you decide to extend your au pair program  you must fulfill new education requirements  and host parents must help pay. Au Pair USA hopes these answers provide clear guidance about the educational requirement for au pairs! Remember  your Local Coordinator orAu Pair Handbookare wonderful sources of information if you have further questions about the au pair  educational requirement.

Get to Know Super Au Pair Finalist Dani!,Since her first interview with the Cassidy family  Dani felt a connection. She’d had other interviews prior  but it didn’t feel the same. “When I was talking with them  I really felt that they were interested in me and my experience as an au pair. I felt they wanted me to enjoy my au pair experience and I really appreciated that ” Dani recalls. Dani also felt the Cassidys were patient with her English during their chats. She felt comfortable talking to them in her non-native language  despite the challenges of using words and grammar she wasn’t used to using on a daily basis. As Dani prepared for her departure from Mexico City to Pennsylvania  the Cassidys sent Dani information about their local city  Philadelphia. Dani’s brother  an avidRockyfan  let her know she was going to be enteringRockyterritory living in Philly. During her first weekend  the Cassidys took Dani to the famousRocky stepsat the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Host dad Brian and au pair Dani ran up the steps humming the Rocky theme song. It was a fun memory and a great way to kick off Dani’s au pair year with the Cassidys.   Dani has loved taking care of now nine-month-old baby boy Hart. Since day one  Hart has shown her how much he’s taken to Dani through his smile. Dani says  “He is warm  just like his parents.” Taking care of a young baby can present its challenges  but Dani has loved watching him grow and change as the months go by. With host mom Kate working from home  Dani and Kate will often talk about Hart’s development and care. It’s usually the topic of conversation during their daily lunch dates at home during Hart’s nap time. “She is a good listener. She gives good advice. I really appreciate that we talk. She asks me how I feel ” Dani says about her host mom. Cultural exchange has been a huge part of Dani’s and the Cassidy’s au pair program experience. Sharing a love for music and literature  Dani and host dad Brian have exchanged ideas about music genres and books. Brian has introduced Dani to new and different kinds of American music and Dani has shared cumbia and salsa music with Brian  typical sounds of Mexico City  where Dani is from. The social and extroverted Cassidys always include Dani in their plans as well  so she never feels left out. This past November  Dani got to experience Thanksgiving for the first time. She appreciated that Americans celebrate a holiday solely dedicated to giving thanks.   The thoughtful Cassidys continue to treat Dani with gratitude and generosity. During their interviews  Dani had shared with them how much she’d always wanted to visit New York. Kate and Brian bought her a ticket  asked some friends if she could stay with them in Brooklyn  and organized a trip for her to visit this long-awaited destination. They also gifted her a flight home to Mexico City for Christmas so she could enjoy the holiday with her natural family. Both Kate and Brian have been to Mexico City multiple times before  and Dani hopes that they’ll return in the future to visit her. “I’m excited to think they will visit me in the future and I can share with them my city.” Congratulations  Dani  on being a 2024Super Au PairFinalist!

Get to Know Au Pair USA’s 2024 Super Au Pair: Carla!,Any au pair would probably feel a little nervous about joining a family withfive kids. But for Carla  a 26-year-old au pair from Mexico  those fears didn’t last long. From the interview process with the Sharkey family in March 2023  Carla knew right away that this would be an incredible match. The conversation flowed nicely. They were funny and positive  and they had so much in common  including skiing  running  and musical theatre.   Joining a “quilted family” as host dad Mike Sharkey puts it  Carla rose to the challenge. Not only had this family blended five children together after the deaths of a biological mom and dad  but they’d only begun living together 20 days prior to Carla’s arrival after Mike and Marisa got married. Carla’s initial nerves of moving abroad and taking care of five kids escaped quickly though  as the Sharkeys made her immediately feel comfortable and welcome. Shortly after settling in  devastation occurred in the form of a house fire. The Sharkeys had just completed a home renovation and moved into their dream house. They were eager to begin this next chapter of their lives as one family unit  Carla included. During dinner one evening  the family heard noises by the chimney  but thought nothing of it. They enjoyed their meal and conversation as usual  laughing and chatting about their day. After dinner  Carla started making lunches for the next day  while some of the kids were getting ready for bed. A neighbor knocked on the door and told them the chimney was on fire! Carla quickly got the kids and dog out of the house. She was the calming force in a time of chaos  running after the Sharkey’s son who wanted to return to the home after evacuating and wiping tears from others who sat filled with fear. Even though Carla was scared too (fire is her biggest fear even before this happened)  she was able to step up as a caregiver and support system to the Sharkey kids during this critical time. Carla credits her ability to be so strong to her host parents  who are a constant positive force no matter what the circumstances. She recalls host dad Mike telling the visibly upset children that night  “If there’s a family that knows how to pivot  it’s us.” The weeks that followed were probably the most challenging for au pair Carla. She was responsible for helping move six people’s belongings into temporary housing. The stress and anxiety of making sure she didn’t forget anything for herself or her host kids was tough. She remembers packing a box for everyone during that week  while the host parents handled all the necessary steps with insurance  a temporary home  etc. “It was around the holidays  so I was feeling pretty down. We did it as a team and as a family  so it went by quickly”  Carla recalls. While the home fire and aftermath may have been a bump in the road  Carla’s au pair experience with the Sharkeys has presented many happy memories and experiences. With all their commonalities  they’ve enjoyed skiing together in the Colorado mountains and running together on Saturday mornings as a family. Host dad Mike has even helped Carla train for two marathons since her arrival in 2023.   Perhaps the most memorable of Carla’s experiences with the Sharkeys  however  has been being present for the cross adoption of the children. In summer 2024  Mike and Marisa cross-adopted each other’s children. “I never thought I’d experience it in the U.S. or anywhere. It was a unique experience”  Carla recalls. “The priest was there and the grandparents. When they made it official and hugged  it was a very sweet moment.”   Carla’s two-year au pair program will be coming to an end in July 2025.  While this departure will certainly be a sad one  Carla and the Sharkeys will most certainly remain family for life. Experiences like a home fire may be hard in the moment  but they also strengthen relationships like no other. “This program is amazing. It gives you the chance to explore and connect  but the Sharkeys have made it a lot more special for me.” Thank you  Carla for sharing your story and for being Au Pair USA’s2024 Super Au Pair!

Understanding American Holiday Culture,This post was originally published in December 2015 and revised by other contributors in December 2024. The holiday season is upon us! Here’s a quick overview of holidays celebrated in the U.S. to to get you acclimated to some of fall’s main celebrations  American style: This holiday gives children the opportunity to dress up in their scariest (or prettiest  or wackiest) outfits  while running around the neighborhood  yelling “trick or treat!” and filling pillowcases with fun-sized chocolates and candies. Take note that many people of all ages celebrateHalloween. Don’t be surprised if almost everyone on your block is handing out candy  if your children wear costumes to a school event  or even if your host parents or you get invited to a Halloween party! However  some families choose not to celebrate Halloween for religious reasons. Be sure you and your host family are on the same page before making jack-o-lanterns with the kids! Thanksgiving  or “Turkey Day” as you may hear it referred to  commemorates a feast shared by both indigenous Americans and early Pilgrims to the New World. This day brings American families together to cook a massive feast  eat it together  view a football game  and to remember to give thanks for the food  family  and other good fortune they have. Many workers are given a day off on both Thursday and Friday. During this holiday  many Americans make the journey back to their hometowns or to the cities where other loved ones live in an effort to share with their family. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics Thanksgiving is the most heavily traveled time of year! While not an official holiday  Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving and is worth mentioning here. It’s the biggest sale day of the year for shopping! Nearly every store offers lower pricing on their products on Black Friday in preparation for gift buyers starting their Christmas  Hanukkah  and Kwanzaa shopping. Be sure to take advantage of some of these deals  but also beware: stores are crowded  lines are long  and high-demand products may sell out quickly. If crowded shopping isn’t your thing  don’t worry. Most stores will offer online savings as well! This eight-day festival of lights commemorates the rededication of the holy Temple in Jerusalem after the reclamation from Greek-Syrian conquerors. Jewish families celebrate Hanukkah by lighting thehanukkiah(usually referred to as amenorah). Each night at sundown  another candle is lit until at the end of the celebration all of the eight candles are glowing (the candle in the middle is used to light the others  so there are nine in total). Families also exchange gifts each evening and share traditional foods such as potato pancakes  calledlatkes  and jelly-filled doughnuts. People of all ages  but especially children  love playingdreideland giving outgelt! While a traditionally Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ  the celebration of Christmas has integrated itself into secular United States culture. Don’t be surprised to see garland  bows  fake snow  bells  Santa  and signs wishing everyone a “Merry Christmas!” or “Happy Holidays!” around your city. There are many Americans who do not celebrate Christmas. If you’re not sure if someone celebrates Christmas or not  it’s good form to tell people “Happy Holidays!” rather than “Merry Christmas!” Christmas is a time for gift-giving and sharing a meal with family. Much like Thanksgiving  this is a big time for travel. Many people do their best to make it “home for Christmas” – even if it is the only time of the year that they see their family. Children will eagerly await the arrival of Santa Claus  who – the story goes – comes down the chimney on Christmas Eve in order to stuff children’s stockings with goodies and leave gifts under the Christmas tree! Kwanzaais a weeklong celebration that honors African heritage in African-American culture. Kwanzaa is observed from December 26th to January 1st  and ends with a celebratory meal and gift exchange. Kwanzaa is a relatively newer holiday than Hanukkah or Christmas  having begun in 1966.There are seven principles  which coordinate with the seven days and seven candles that are lit throughout the week: Umoja (unity)  Kujichagulia (self-determination)  Ujima (collective work and responsibility)  Ujamaa (cooperative economics)  Nia (purpose)  Kuumba (creativity) and Imani (faith). Kwanzaa is not a religious holiday. New Year’s Eve is a night to celebrate the past year and welcome the new one! Depending on your host family’s plans  you may have the night off to hang out with friends  or you might be working so your host parents can enjoy a party or event for adults only  since New Year’s events usually don’t end until after midnight. No matter your plans  it will be a New Year’s Eve to remember—one you spent in the U.S. The holiday season can be a busy time of year  filled with many parties  events  and social gatherings. Whether the holidays you celebrate during your au pair program year are similar to or different from what you’ve experienced before  the holiday season is a wonderful time to experience cultural exchange with new family and friends. Be intentional about participating in these experiences. You’ll create so many wonderful new memories by doing so!

When Cultural Exchange Transforms Family to Famiglia,TheAu Pair USA programis more than just a childcare solution for busy families—it creates opportunities for genuine cultural exchange and lifelong connections. The story of Marianna  a 26-year-old au pair from Puglia  Italy  and her host family demonstrates how this program can transform lives and create bonds that extend far beyond the au pair program’s official duration  which is usually one to two years. Findingthe right host familyis crucial for any au pair’s success. For Marianna  like many others  the prospect of moving to a new country brought considerable anxiety. “Before being an au pair  I was so scared to come to the USA and find a family that wasn’t good ” she recalls. “I was scared to go into a rematch and change (my) family or go back home.” Her host family  consisting of Eleanor  Pierpaolo  their 3-year-old son Elio  and baby Valentino  had their own specific hopes for the program. As Eleanor explains  “We wanted someone to join our family that we could trust and have close to us  and who would be a real part of our family.” With Pierpaolo’s Italian heritage  they specifically sought an Italian au pair who could help maintain their children’s connection to their cultural roots. During the interview process  Marianna stood out immediately. “She was the best!! Mature  interesting  kind  humble and seemed genuinely interested in meeting us and joining our lives ” Eleanor shares. This initial impression grew into a deeper relationship that extended beyond typical host family-au pair bonds. Since Marianna’s arrival in May 2023  she has become an integral part of the family. “I love my host family because they treat me like a real member of the family ” she says. “They respect me  respect my space and my free time. I love that they respect my working hours without ever exceeding them.” This adherence toprogram rules and regulationsis particularly important  as it creates a foundation of mutual respect and trust. Marianna’s relationship with baby Valentino has been very special. Having cared for him since he was just one month old  their connection grew so strong that “Marianna” became his first word! The depth of their connection became clear during a Christmas celebration on December 23rd. During the festivities with extended family  Marianna surprised her host family with a poster asking to extend her stay for another year. Their response wasn’t just an enthusiastic “yes!” And they had a surprise of their own: asking Marianna to become Valentino’s godmother. “I will remember that day for the rest of my life ” Marianna recalls  her voice full of emotion. “We all were happy and crying tears of joy.” This moment transformed their relationship from a temporary childcare arrangement into a permanent family bond. On March 9  2024  both families gathered in Cormons  a town in northern Italy  for Valentino’s baptism. The celebration beautifully merged both families and cultures. Marianna’s family traveled from Puglia  bringing traditional dishes like focaccia  mozzarella  and stracciatella  creating a feast that celebrated both the spiritual occasion and their newfound family connections. The end of Marianna’s au pair program won’t mark the end of their relationship. “I will always be present in Valentino’s life ” she affirms. “I will come back and visit him after my 2 years of au pair  they can come to Italy and visit me ALL THE TIME  WHENEVER THEY WANT.“ Eleanor shares this sentiment with humor: “She’s stuck with us! We’ll bring the boys to visit her in Puglia  and she can come back to visit any time  and when the boys are older we’ll send them to spend summers with her.“ Marianna’s story exemplifies how theAu Pair programcan create lasting impacts beyond its primary goals. While the au pair program is designed to provide childcare while promoting cultural exchange  in cases like Marianna’s  it creates something even more valuable: lifelong family bonds that span continents and cultures. When both host family and au pair approach the experience with openness  respect  and genuine care  the rewards can far exceed expectations  creating connections that last a lifetime.

Thanksgiving Tips for Au Pairs,This post was originally published in November 2021 and was revised by other contributors in November 2024. Experiencing American holidays is one of the best parts of being on the Au Pair cultural exchange program. On the fourth Thursday of November most people in the U.S. celebrateThanksgiving. You’ve probably heard stories or seen movies that showed families celebrating Thanksgiving together. You might be thinking  ‘That food looks strange’ or ‘Why do Americans watch football on this day?’ We want to give you some tips for getting the most out of this ultra-American holiday. Thanksgiving originated in 1621 when the Plymouth colonists (or “Pilgrims”) and the native Wampanoag people shared an feast after a plentiful autumn harvest. [Learn more about the history of Thanksgiving]. Nowadays  Thanksgiving remains a day where families and friends get together to express gratitude. It’s tradition to eat a big meal on Thanksgiving. Here are some things you’ll likely see on the dinner table: turkey  stuffing  cranberry sauce  gravy  mashed potatoes  sweet potatoes  and pumpkin pie just to name a few. The food may look weird and unfamiliar to you  but try it all!  Jacqueline  an au pair from Brazil  said  “At first everything was strange  and I didn’t think I would like anything. But  it became my favorite meal in this country since then.” First  don’t be shy to share your culture.The first Thanksgiving was a celebration of cultural exchange  with the Native Americans teaching the Pilgrims how to hunt and find local fruits like grapes and cranberries. In return  the Pilgrims introduced English crops like cabbage and carrots to the menu. Let that be even more of a reason to add some authentic El Salvadorian pupusas to your host family’s appetizer spread  or a delicious Italian tiramisu to the dessert selection. Jacqueline said  “My host kids love when I make brigadeiro  a typical Brazilian dessert”. You may be asked to share about something you’re grateful for as part of the conversation during dinner. You can probably think of many things this year  especially as an au pair! Many American families watchNFL footballon Thanksgiving Day. The NFL has been playing football games on Thanksgiving Day since 1934. Two teams who almost always play on this day are the Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions. You might also want to tune into the famousMacy’s Thanksgiving Day parade. It’s been a tradition in New York City since 1924 and is broadcast across the country. Ask your host family what channel you can watch the parade on Thanksgiving morning. If you’re close to Manhattan  you may want to go watch it in person! Although not exactly part of Thanksgiving Black Fridayis a big day for sales. It usually begins on Thanksgiving night. Many host parents will have the Friday after Thanksgiving (Black Friday) off from work and they may want to do some holiday shopping. Be sure to ask what your schedule will be on Black Friday before making your shopping plans! Whether you’re celebrating with your host family or new friends  be sure to make it a day to remember. Try new foods  watch new sports  check out the parade  and share what you’re thankful for this year! And remember that Thanksgiving is just the beginning of the holiday season in the USA!

Enjoying the Trip, No Matter What!,When Alexa (26) from Germany joined the Au Pair program  she was excited to match with an incredible host family with three adorable kiddos. After leaving her office job in Germany and arriving in the Seattle Washingtonarea in August 2024  Alexa settled in as a full-time  live-in caregiver to a six-month-old  two- and three-year-old. She soon found her groove as an au pair  managing the two toddlers and a baby. She also quickly made friends with au pairs in the vicinity and began her cultural exchange experience. Being an avid traveler in Europe and having visited many countries like Spain  Italy  Greece  Hungary  Montenegro  Albania  and Israel  Alexa knew she wanted to alsotravelas much as possible during her time in the U.S. So  when her au pair friend  Rika (19)  from South Africa invited her on a spontaneous trip to Chicago one weekend  she couldn’t say no! After clearing her vacation plans with herhost family  Alexa and Rika flew out of Washington on a Thursday night redeye flight  arriving Friday morning in Chicago. What happened next was not in the travel plans though. Rika lost her purse! Having no money or ID while traveling is certainly challenging. Add being in a foreign country to the mix  and it’s even more stressful. Alexa and Rika spent their first hours in Chicago filing a police report and figuring out next steps to navigate the situation. Once they had taken all the necessary steps  they began a fun day in a new city. The off-duty au pairs walked around Chicago  visiting touristy spots likeThe Bean. They took a boat trip and ended their first day with hamburgers in their hotel room. The rest of the trip was filled with exploratory walks and popping into planned places like The Nutella Cafe  where they enjoyed delicious ice cream.  It was a great lesson for me to take things easy  because if you can’t change it  you can still make the best out of the situation you’re in. -Alexa  Alexa and Rika finally boarded their flight home to Washington after an adventure-packed weekend and returned home Sunday morning. Alexa’s host family picked them up from the airport. After doing laundry  showering  and then taking a long nap so she was well rested for work on Monday  Alexa was grateful for the incredible trip she’d been able to experience with her new friend  despite the unfortunate purse incident. We asked what her tips would be for traveling since she has been to so many places  here’s what Alexa had to say: It’s very important to look up some stuff in advance . Know where you want to go  a special restaurant to try or shop to go to. I like to go with the flow  but I am also a little more structured when I visit a new place so I do some research in advance-like on TikTok or Instagram or with some bloggers who have been to this city before. -Alexa Watch your stuff so you don’t lose anything. Enjoy your time even if you do lose it though. Time is too short to be sad or mad about the things you can’t change. -Alexa We’re glad you had a great trip  Alexa and Rika!

Au Pair Educational Course Requirements Frequently Asked Questions,This post was originally published in April 2019 and revised in September 2024 by other contributors. As part of theU.S. Department of State’s Au Pair Program regulations  au pairs are required to complete at least six semester hours of credit at anaccreditedpost-secondary institution during their program year. This educational requirement provides a fantastic way for you to pursue your educational interests  meet new people  and experience an important aspect of American culture. Host families are required to give au pairs up to$500 towards these educational classes per program year. Here are some frequently asked questions about the au pair education requirement. This information is also in the Au Pair USAAu Pair Handbook. Your Local Coordinator will have advice about eligible classes in your area. Six credits over the course of the au pair program year are required. A typical college-level class earns 3 credits and lasts several months  so it is important to get started finding a class right away. If the class you want to take is at an accredited post-secondary institute but it doesn’t offer credit  you may be able to count the number of hours of class time toward your requirement.. Each 30-hour class is equal to 3 credits  so you’ll likely need to take two classes to complete your au pair educational requirement. As with any other classes  be sure to submit aClass Pre-Approval Formbefore enrolling. Classes must be on the campus of and/or be associated with an accredited post-secondary institution  which is generally a college or university. Keep in mind that library  community center  and church-based classes typically are not accepted unless they are affiliated with an accredited  post-secondary institution. Sometimes classes can be taken virtually as well. Always check that the course you plan to take is through an accredited  post-secondary institution. You should always submit aClass Pre-Approval Formto Au Pair USA before enrolling or paying for a class. Au Pair USA reviews the forms  and will let you know if the course will be approved and how many credits you will receive. Sooner is better! Au Pair USA recommends researching the types of classes you are interested in taking as soon as you’ve matched with a host family. This will give you enough time to discuss the schedule with your host family and get thePre-Approvalprocess started. Keep in mind that most academic terms have specific start dates (often in August and January)  so be sure you have enough time to enroll before the start date. Most classes that earn academic credit at an accredited post-secondary institution are accepted. Classes that earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs) rather than academic credits (typically part of a university Continuing Education Program or Adult Education Program)) should have an academic focus such as language  marketing  history  science  psychology  English as a Second language  and so on. Make sure you getPre-Approvalfor all classes. In general  these classes are not acceptable unless they have a strong academic component and earn credits (not CEUs) at an accredited university. In general  if these classes are held at an accredited academic university  they will be approved. The most important thing to do is submit aClass Pre-Approval Form. Your Local Coordinator can also help you find appropriate course options and answer your questions. Check yourAu Pair USA Passport profileas some pre-approved classes may be listed there as well. Your host family may also be able to help you with local options  especially if they have hosted au pairs before. Weekend au pair courses which earn three credits from an accredited university provide you with an opportunity to earn credit quickly. This is especially useful if you are not able to complete a longer course due to time constraints. However  there are many different class operators and you will still need to make sure that the class you want to take is acceptable to Au Pair USA and affiliated with an accredited university. These classes are generally more expensive than local options because the au pair must pay for travel  food  and lodging in addition to the class’s tuition cost. Remember that au pairs have a $500 educational allowance provided by their host family for their 12-month program to complete the 6 credit hours. Au Pair USA does not accept courses that earn 6 credits in one weekend unless they involve 60 hours of classroom time. Some courses advertise that they will fulfill 60 hours worth of educational hours. However  when looking at the class schedule  only 30 hours are with an instructor learning in an educational environment  and the other 30 hours are assignments before and after. In this case  Au Pair USA would only be able to count the 30 hours of class time. If you are going home after the12-monthprogram is over  your education must be completed before your program end date. If you plan to extend your program  you have to complete the educational requirement before you can submit the extension application  which is no later than45days before your scheduled program end date. Au Pair USA recommends planning early! We cannot submit your extension request to the U.S. Department of State without your completed education component. When the course is finished  au pairs must obtain a school document as proof that they completed the class. This might be a letter  certificate  or transcript from the school. Au pairs then upload those documents to the “End of Year” tab inPassport. You must complete and upload these documents in order to successfully conclude the program. Host parents support au pairs in three ways: Yes. If you decide to extend your au pair program  you must fulfill new education requirements  and host parents must help pay. Au Pair USA hopes these answers provide clear guidance about the educational requirement for au pairs! Remember  your Local Coordinator orAu Pair Handbookare wonderful sources of information if you have further questions about the au pair  educational requirement.

Dogs in American Culture,🎶 “You Ain’t Nothin’ But A Hound Dog…” “Who Let The Dogs Out?” “Hey Bulldog!” 🎶 These songs – made famous by Elvis  Baha Men  and the Beatles respectively – are just a few examples of dogs in American culture. In addition to dogs in song lyrics  you’ll see them in movies – Disney’s101 Dalmatiansis a kid favorite – and filling up prideful owners’ Instagram feeds. In addition to social media feeds  dogs fill homes and hearts as well. South African au pair Shanté was surprised to meet her host family’ssixChihuahuas!Almost halfof U.S. households own a dog  so you’ll have a fifty percent chance of living with one during your time as an au pair. Americanslovedogs – that’s why we’ve put together this guide to help you learn more about dogs in the USA! Since dogs are often considered part of a family  Americans can be passionate about their preferred breeds. Some like big dogs  such as this Siberian Husky: Believe it or not  thebiggest dogs can be the calmest breeds and best with children. (Among pet lovers  animals that are big  yet calm  may be called “gentle giants.”) For this reason  you might see young host kids playing with dogs bigger than they are! Of course  big dogs need a lot of outdoor space to run around and burn energy. This is sometimes lacking in suburban and urban homes  so many families opt for smaller dogs. If you’ve seen any American reality television shows  you might have observed celebrities with tiny  purse-sized dogs. (ThinkParis HiltonorLisa Vanderpump.) There are plenty of breeds in between big and small. Here are theten most popular in the USA: Not surprisingly  most of these breeds aregood with children  so you’ll likely encounter one of each as an au pair in the USA. An interesting fact: while many dogs look like a particular breed  they may in fact be a mixture ofseveralbreeds. A common word for a mixed-breed dog is “mutt ” and they account formore than half of all family dogs in the USA. They also account for95 percent of dogs in shelters. Americans love dogs so much that when we can’t find a home for a dog  or a stray dog is found on the street  it gets taken to a shelter for animals waiting to be “adopted” by families. Whether purebred or mutt  you’ll see dogs onsocial media. Earlier  we mentioned dogs on Instagram. As you can imagine  this phenomenon comes with a wide variety of silly terminology. You might read  for instance  about a “floofy doggo” such as this: Or a “smol puppers” might dominate your social media feed: American families have a wide variety of norms for their dogs. Shanté noted that her host family’s six Chihuahuas spend more time inside the house than out  only going outside to use the bathroom. “It’s different in South Africa ”  she said. “Dogs there spend more time outdoors.” Most host families will keep their dogs inside. Some owners even train and use dogs for home protection. If they do live inside  dogs will often have a specific place to sleep. This might be a small dog bed in the room of a host child or parent; the dog might even sleep in a family member’s bed! (However  please keep in mind that you shouldn’t be asked to interact with the pet if you’re not comfortable doing so. You won’t  for example  be asked to shareyourbed!) Getting to know a dog is an aspect of getting to know a host family! Moreover leaving your comfort zoneis an important aspect of being an au pair – many au pairs complete their program and talk fondly about the waysliving in a new culture helped them grow. And who knows – maybe you’ll end up returning to your home country and going straight to the adoption shelter for a “smol floof” of your very own! 🐶 Matt Wallace was previously the Community & Digital Content Manager for the InterExchange Marketing team.

Independent Report Confirms Win-Win Situation for Au Pairs and Families,Arecently released reportby the independent research group  EurekaFacts  shows that the U.S. Department of State’s Au Pair Program is a valuable win-win arrangement for au pairs and families alike. This first-of-its-kind report surveyed program alumni from the past five years  securing responses from over 15 000 program participants. The report provides the most robust and accurate portrait of the program as experienced by au pairs and host families  and the findings are unquestionably positive! Au pairs were overwhelmingly positive about their experience! More than 84% said that they were “Satisfied” or “Very Satisfied” with the program  and 87% would recommend the program to their friends and family. In fact  one-in-five had heard about the program from a former au pair who had spoken highly of the experience. Au pairs report that their main motivations for joining the program are their desire to “gain new or improved personal skills”  “experience daily life in a different culture”  and  “improve their English skills”. While the au pair program provides a great opportunity for au pairs to earn money to pay for travel and activities  only 25% of au pairs ranked this as being a very important motivating factor when considering whether to participate in the program. More than eight-in-ten au pairs say that they developed greater confidence in communicating with others (83%) and almost all (96%) au pairs say that they are applying the skills and experience they acquired through the program to their professional pursuits. The unique relationship between au pairs and their host families is also illuminated by the report. More than 90% of host families say they had “good” or “very good” experiences establishing personal connections with the au pairs living in their homes. Au pairs overwhelmingly describe being welcomed warmly by their families and that they were able to participate in various family events and holidays. Fully 83% report that they were able to build close personal connections with their host families. The ability to build these close personal connections had great impact on both personal and professional levels for au pair alumni. 86% of au pair alumni say they have stayed in touch with their host family after returning home. It is evident that the au pair program can be a life-changing experience that leads to lifelong relationships. The cultural diplomacy aspects remain one of the key long-term benefits of the program. Au pairs’ attitudes towards American life are now more positive upon completion of the program. About two-thirds have a more positive view of the “American people” (66%)  “American culture” (65%)  and the “U.S. in general” (63%)  and a half (50%) are more positive about the “American family structure.” Even au pairs who already had a high opinion of the U.S. report that the program increased this affinity. Au pairs report that they made friends with Americans and 93% plan to stay in touch with them after they return home. In this way  long-term cultural bridges are being built. Host families report that they feel more connected to the wider world and have learned from their au pairs. Now more than ever  American families are seeking dependable and caring childcare as they navigate the realities presented by COVID-19. In fact  71% of families reported that if the program were no longer available  it would affect them at least “a fair amount ” including the majority (55%) who say it would affect them “a great deal.” Given the multitude of concerns families have right now  hosting an au pair may be one of the safest childcare options available into the foreseeable future. Unlike previous investigations into the au pair program which focused on a handful of au pairs who had had bad experiences  this report relies on the responses of thousands of au pair and host family alumni to inform its findings. In doing so it has created the most accurate and reliable assessment of the au pair program to date. Overwhelmingly  the findings demonstrate positive program outcomes for both families and au pairs by providing valuable opportunities for personal and professional growth  family enrichment  and child development  all while strengthening the U.S. image  local economies  and views of Americans in the process.

Lucas Has 5 Lessons Every Au Pair Should Know,Lucas “Poppins” was a great au pair. But he wasn’t born great – his success is the result of conscious efforts to develop his skills  patience  and open-mindedness. A few years ago we chatted with Lucas on IG Live  and he shared some tips with us. Here are five lessons that Lucas wants every au pair to know: Lucas used to be an English teacher in Brazil  so he was initially confident about his language skills. But he quickly had to adjust his expectations when he got to the U.S. “When you arrive in another country for the first time ” he says  “you learn that your English is not as good as you previously thought it was.” You can study before coming  but the only thing that will really improve is actually being in the country and practicing. “You will mess up occasionally ” he says  “but you need to keep practicing.” When he was matching with a host family  Lucas knew immediately when he had found the right one. To use an English expression  “something just clicked.” He felt that his host family were like siblings  and he was confident that they would support him during difficult times. His intuition was proven correct  and he extended the program with his host family. Lucas’s host family advice is  unsurprisingly  to “take an opportunity to become comfortable with your host family before coming to the USA.” It didn’t take long for Lucas to start missing home. That’s a normal part of traveling. The first thing Lucas longed for was home-cooked Brazlian food. But he opened himself to new experiences and dove into American fare. He came to love New Orleans for its range of food  including jambalaya and gumbo. Lucas also opened up to other U.S. experiences: seeing American football and baseball games with his host family. Most impressively  he even entered a photo contest – atBaltimore festival Artscape– andwon! Indeed  creativity was an asset to Lucas during his time as an au pair  and evenbefore. During the host family matching process  he impressed his future host family by dressing up as various superheroes in his introduction video. Lucas also used his own experiences and interests to connect with his host kid. Drawing on his experience as a former English teacher  he devised fun games to help his host kid read. Lucas’s creativity leads us to his fifth and final tip for new au pairs: find positivity in frustrating situations. Lucas’s time as an au pair coincided with the onset of COVID-19. But Lucas was undeterred. His inspiration – andInstagram namesake– came from the American movieMary Poppins. He was impressed with the title character’s energy  enthusiasm  and positivity  and consequently redubbed himself “Lucas Poppins.” What advice would he give to an au pair feeling down? When you’re about to “lose your head ” he says  “apply yourself creatively!” While Lucas is amazing  he’s not the only one: there are many stellar Au Pair USA au pairs!

Safely Venturing Out Post-Lockdown,Updated 30 April 2021. Are you having trouble remembering the “before times”? As the USA reopens  folks are starting to venture out while adhering to federal  state and local guidance. Your area may be starting to open up a little. The Center for Disease Controlrevised its mask guidance in April 2021: Masks may not be necessary when you are outside or with people who live in your household. It may be a good time to come up with some ideas about things that you can do outside with the kids and how to ensure that it is done safely. Guidelines about social distancing and face coverings are mostly being organized on a state and local level  so look into what is required and discuss that with your host family. The key questions are  “Who needs to wear a face covering?” and  “Under what circumstances do they need to wear them?” You can find the information you need on the website for your state or local county. Keep in mind  what you see others doing may not be a good indicator of the actual rules. Talk to your host family about being around other children at playgrounds or other communal areas that may have opened in your area. What are their expectations about water fountains  hand sanitizer  and wiping down equipment. Everyone is still working through these questions  so having a discussion with your host family will help you feel more confident when you are out. Pack a bag ahead of time so you are ready to go! Pack enough masks and face coverings for everyone  plus a few extra. Pack a couple of bottles of hand sanitizer  some disinfectant wipes  sunscreen  water  and  of course  snacks! Having everything ready to go will make getting out of the house much easier. Here are some quick ideas for easy activities outside with your kids! Take some time to explore your area on apps and websites like google maps. You can often find parks and places of interest. You can “star” the ones that seem like good options and save them so you can easily find them again. Have any other ideas? Please let us know! Send us anInstagramorFacebookmessage!

Building Diversity into Your Children’s Book Library,Ibram Kendi  an American academic and journalist  has beenin the news a lot recently. He writes practically and compellingly on the topic of how to be actively anti-racist. Anyone with a child in their life knows that it’s difficult to balance entertaining books with educational books. And this is only more difficult when the child is younger.Antiracist Babyseeks to solve this problem “with bold art and thoughtful yet playful text… introducing the youngest readers and the grown-ups in their lives to the concept and power of antiracism.” In Yangsook Choi’s award-winning bookThe Name Jar  Unhei  a young girl from Korea  moves to the United States and is initially embarrassed about her name. This book – whether read to  orby  a child – will allow them to begin considering the difficulties of conflicting cultural identities experienced by many immigrant and first-generation citizens in the U.S. As kids get older  their capacity to retain knowledge grows. Grade school ages  therefore  are the perfect opportunity to help them learn and categorize their knowledge of other countries’ cultures.Children Just Like Me: A Unique Celebration of Children Around the Worldby Anabel and Barnabas Kindersleypresents a hypothetical kid from each nation of the world  discussing what clothes they may wear  their hobbies  what they might eat for dinner  etc. This lets a child start to see their peers around the world as less an “other” than as simply another kid. Of course  humans are more diverse than their countries of origin  and children about to go into middle school are able to recognize this.Insignificant Events in the Life of a Cactus  by Dusti Bowling  is about a girl born without arms. Although one might fear that the book would be melodramatic  it’s written from a practical perspective as the girl tries to  simply  be a girl. She spends more time thinking about the things she can do  rather than what she can’t do. Dusti doesn’t beg us to feel for her protagonist  but we will anyway. And that’s what empathy is all about. Teens are ready for even more mature subject matter. Cultural explorations become less metaphorical and more literal.Refugee  by Alan Gratz  presents the stories of three child refugees  from Nazi Germany  Cuba  and modern Syria. Book reviewerKirkus Reviewsdescribes it as “poignant  respectful  and historically accurate while pulsating with emotional turmoil  adventure  and suspense.” But most importantly  it allows young people to build empathy for others who may neither look like them  nor speak their language. At this moment in global history  empathy is especially crucial. The last several months have seen recent memory’s largest demonstrations in support of racial justice. Au pairs and parents might struggle to articulate these demonstrations to their children. Moreover  evendevelopmental experts are not in agreementregarding proper ages for kids to learn about disturbing topics such as racism. Nevertheless  every parent wants their child to grow up with an open mind and heart. The answer: books. Don’t worry  we have plenty more recommendations – stay tuned!

Expand Your Post-Au Pair Career Prospects,A favorite idiom reads  “every cloud has a silver lining.” During COVID  one of those silver linings is the choice of thousands of online course opportunities across the United States. As part of the J-1 Cultural Exchange Visa program  au pairs must complete 6 credits (or 60 contact hours) of in-person classes to receive a completion certificate. With most face-to-face courses moved to an online platform during the pandemic  Au Pair USA currently has approval from the U.S. Department of State to accept online courses  with some conditions. There are many opportunities across a broad range of subjects  includingsynchronous(set time for classes) andasynchronous(pre-recorded). Once in-person classes return  the online option will no longer exist  so jump in and find a course that suits you! Two large-scale platforms for online courses areCourseraandedX. Both include thousands of university-level courses across many subjects. Please remember that courses must be academic and offered by a fully accredited  post-secondary (university-level) institution in the United States. Hobby subjects like exercise and art courses are not sufficient. Know that weekend courses specifically designed for au pairs will frequently count for fewer credit hours than advertised. Au pairs are responsible for submitting classes to bepre-approved for creditby Au Pair USA before signing up. If an au pair wishes to extend  courses must be completed by thebeginning of the 11th month. This spring and summer  au pairs could choose classes not usually offered in their local colleges. Riccardo from Colorado has been able to use skills he learned in his Yale University course The Science of Wellbeing  as an au pair. “I did exercises on patience  listening  and stress relief. The class helped me understand that you don’t find happiness with material things  but that happiness comes from within.” Teale from New Jersey loved learning about thecity and culture of Miami through BMCC. “We had virtual tours of the city as we learned about the diversity  history  and architecture. The teacher incorporated games for the students to make connections with each other  and I met other au pairs in my area through the class.” There are a wide variety of English courses available online. Akane in New York attended the University of Pennsylvania’s Coursera class English for Science  Technology  Engineering  and Mathematics. “It was interesting to obtain ideas and news of the latest environmental issues throughout the course. I recommend this course for someone eager to expand their academic vocabulary.” Here are some tips for successfully keeping up with an asynchronous class: Talk with your local coordinator  remember tosubmit classes for pre-approval  and explore all the online course possibilities while you can!

How Local Coordinators Have Been Supporting Au Pairs During COVID-19,Have you heard the expression “bloom where you are planted”? Even when life is difficult  one can make the most out of opportunities in their current situation. While social distancing has forced the world to plant themselves indoors  people are blooming. Many au pairs remained in the USA after sheltering in place to continue supporting their host families. Au Pair USA’s team of Local Coordinators has been working to support au pairs during these difficult times. We’re proud to report that our Local Coordinators have helped their au pairs bloom! Our Local Coordinator team has been making sure that their au pairs are safe and healthy via frequent check-ins and virtual group meetings. Local Coordinator Pamela Piggott reports that her Washington state check-ins continued virtually  with games such as “two truths and a lie ” and “how many states can you name in thirty seconds.” “We shared laughs and everyone got really creative ” she said. Local Coordinator Emily relates that one of her au pairs did a virtual make-up session  but she “had no idea there were so many steps to applying makeup!” Things weren’t always easy  however.Exchangeis  of course  an essential part of cultural exchange. Au pairs came to the USA eager to experience American culture. Like much of the world  they’ve had to change their expectations over the past months. Understandably  some have gotten restless. An important Local Coordinator duty has therefore been ensuring that au pairs and host families are on the same page regarding safety. Regional Supervisor Cara Harper had to remind her au pairs that  even as businesses in Georgia opened up  they were still expected to follow host family guidelines. Nevertheless  she strove to find a balance and accommodate cultural exchange. For example  she suggested that families might be supportive of au pairs meeting friends so long as they wear masks and ensure physical distance. Communication and planning are key. On June 20  Local Coordinator Tracy Hanover held her first (socially-distanced) meetup for Pennsylvania au pairs since quarantine began. It went great ” she says. “I loved seeing my au pairs in person. I’m still amazed at how well they are all handling this  and even more blessed that their host families are so loving and understanding during it all.” Pride in au pairs has been contagious. To show their appreciation  many Local Coordinators have prepared small  thoughtful gifts. A few North Carolinians stood out. Mary Beth Grealey dropped off candy and gift cards to a local ice cream shop  along with a personalized note to each au pair. Suzanne Miller took microwave popcorn and sidewalk chalk to hers. Similarly  Tauryn Beeman  in Washington  mailed gift cards to a local Washington ice cream spot  in “sweet” cards noting how much better they’ve made this time for their kids and families. But that’s not all: Suzanne made posters with her own children  and when she dropped off the gifts  they honked  waved  and formed a mini-parade. She also put her graphic design skills to use. In addition to a bag of goodies  she dropped off packets of sunflower seeds and a card with this design: Thanks to Au Pair USA’s team of dedicated Local Coordinators  au pairs are both literallyand figurativelyblooming where they’re planted!

Au Pairing During COVID-19,While COVID-19 has affected many cultural exchange programs  many au pairs who arrived prior to social distancing regulations are still nobly supporting their host families. Au Pair USA sat down with host mom Lily Nguyen to discuss how COVID-19 has affected her life with Brazilian au pair Karolaine  and what Au Pair USA has done to support her in these difficult times. Lily: Our usual schedule was to have Karolaine help out in the mornings with getting the boys out of bed  breakfast  and driving to school. She will then pick up the boys when school is over and take them home for an early dinner or take them to their after school activities such as piano or swim lessons. Since COVID-19  this schedule has changed a lot. Karolaine now generally works 8 am to 5 pm Monday to Friday and a few hours here and there during the week. She is also taking on the role as their organizer of activities. My husband and I both work from home now so this help has been invaluable. “When we knew the kids would be home due to COVID-19  I pulled together a general schedule for Karolaine to follow so that she and the boys knew what to expect. I reviewed the schedule with her and the kids and asked for their input as well. Overall  we have breakfast in the morning and then 1-2 hours of school work. After that  she will take the kids outside and they go for a walk in our neighborhood  ride their bikes or play basketball  etc. After this is some quiet time  book reading  etc.  until lunch. After lunch is one hour of TV and then for the remainder of the afternoon Karolaine will work with them on crafting items  reading more books together  playing with puzzles or legos  board games  etc.  until my husband  Justin  and I are finished with work.” “They have been taking Yoga classes together as well as watching shows likeHow It’s Made.” “There are some good online museum visit sites  math and spelling programs  etc.  and I have also purchasedRaz Kids  which Karolaine can use with the kids to give them variety on their reading assignments.” (Indeed  au pairs often have funhelping kids with homework) “We are spending more time cooking and eating lunch and dinner together. The boys know that we are home and will come sneak in  which is fun  and I get to see them throughout the day. Also we are close by if Karolaine has a question or needs help.” “We are cooking more  we take walks together  and we are watching more movies as a family.” “At mealtimes  we ask the boys what they are doing during the day. We ask everyone to talk about their feelings and how they feel about having to be home and missing out on school and friends. I think communication and knowing that we are here together and getting through the emotions of this change together is important. I also often ask Karolaine about her parents and sisters. I show that I am concerned for their well-being as well.” “We each call our parents and sometimes use Facetime and Skype.” “We can have a productive home life and have space to each do the things we need and still get our work done. I also found out how appreciative I am that I have an au pair that lives with us and can help us consistently Monday through Friday with childcare during normal working hours. I don’t think I would survive with my sanity intact without Karolaine.” “Mary Beth is contacting us more and asking how she can be helpful. The email she sent out with all the links to great educational sites was really helpful. Also  her close contact with Karolaine is very helpful as well  just to make sure she is doing well.” In difficult times  the Au Pair USA community bands together for support. When schools closed to facilitate social distancing  the program shared these resources to support host families’ transition to social distancing: But Local Coordinators don’t just support the host family;they ensure the au pair thrives as well. And what do you get when you add a thriving au pair to a supported host family? The most important outcome of all: happy  healthy host children.

What is Presidents Day?,On the third Monday of every February  we celebrate Presidents Day. This day  which was originally celebrated on George Washington’s birthday  honors our presidents  past and present. Because both George Washington and Abraham Lincoln had profound and lasting impacts on United States history  and both were born in February  we focus on honoring these particular presidents on this day. In preparation for Presidents Day  your host children may be discussing these presidents as part of their school work. Be sure to ask your host children what they know about the presidents – they will be proud to share their knowledge with you  and you may learn something new! Here’s some historical information describing what these presidents are known for: George Washington was the first President of the United States of America. He served as President from April 30  1789 until March 4  1797. George Washington was born to a wealthy Virginia family on February 22  1732. When Washington was born  the United States was not an independent nation  and Virginia was a colony of Britain. Washington began his military career as a young man  when he joined the Virginia militia and fought for Britain in theSeven Years’ War  where he led several campaigns. He then returned to his home  and was elected to Virginia’s House of Burgesses. In order to pay for this war  the British taxed the colonists. The Colonists felt that Britain was exploiting them for its own benefit  and they revolted by throwing tea into the Boston Harbor. This event is called theBoston Tea Party. In 1775  Washington was elected to the First Continental Congress. One month later  the Revolutionary War began  which aimed to make the colonies independent from the British. Washington won his first battle against the British in Boston and continued to lead troops through a series of difficult and bloody battles. In 1776  the Colonists declared their independence from the British  and the British were finally defeated in 1781  surrendering at Yorktown. George Washington agreed to serve as President of the United States in order to unify the new country. He is the only President in U.S. history to be unanimously elected to the office. Washington refused a third Presidential term  saying in his farewell speech that a longer rule would give one man too much power  which would conflict with the spirit of a true democracy. Abraham Lincoln  the 16th President of the United States  is remembered as the one of the greatest presidents in U.S. History. Born in 1809 in a log cabin in rural Kentucky  Lincoln had a difficult childhood and lost his mother at a young age. Despite his parents being illiterate  Lincoln learned to read and educated himself. He taught himself law and passed the bar exam. He began his involvement in politics in 1834 when he was elected to the Illinois state legislature. He then served a term in the U.S. House of Representatives and temporarily left politics to return to practicing law. Lincoln returned to politics when the Kansas-Nebraska act  which allowed states to choose whether or not to legalize slavery  was passed. Based on his belief that slavery was morally wrong  Lincoln was motivated to join the Republican Party. In 1860  he was elected President  and created a strong and ideologically diverse cabinet. Before his inauguration in March of 1861  seven southern states had “seceded from the Union”  meaning that they left the United States and declared themselves a separate nation. Lincoln did not accept this secession and made it his mission to preserve the Union. When Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter  in South Carolina  theCivil Warbegan. In 1863  President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation  proclaiming freedom for slaves in the ten states still in rebellion at the time  and paving the way for slavery’s eventual abolition. In the following year  Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address  which explained the Civil War’s purpose  and became the most famous speech of Lincoln’s presidency. Following this speech  Lincoln was elected for a second term as President. The Civil War lasted four years and eventually ended with the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in Appomattox to Union General Ulysses S. Grant in 1865. Shortly after this victory  however  Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth  a Confederate sympathizer. For further reading about Abraham Lincoln  we suggest readingTeam of Rivals  by Doris Kearns Goodwin Because Presidents Day is a federal holiday  children will probably not have school and parents may have the day off work! Talk to your host family as to how you plan to spend this holiday – it may be a great time to spend some quality time as a family  or perhaps to take off and explore on your own!

Returning Home – Who Au Pairs Can Ask For Letters of Recommendation,As you near theend of your au pair program  it’s time to prepare for the next phase of your life. You may be returning to school and/or job hunting.This post will explain who au pairs can ask for letters of recommendation  what to ask for  when au pairs should request them  and what comes next once you receive your references. You may In both cases  having an updated resume or C.V. and letters of recommendation will be helpful. Upon successful completion of your au pair program  you will receive a completion certificate after returning to your home country  but you should consider requesting reference letters before you depart. Many jobs require that you provide two or three references who can speak to your past performances as an employee. As your employer  your host family is the best place to start. They can speak about your performance in your role as an au pair. Other responsible adults who can talk about your abilities and attitude might be your professors from your classes  your Local Coordinator  or someone you worked with on a volunteer project while in the U.S. When you decide who you would like to act as a reference  you should always first ask them if they would be willing. Never list someone as a reference unless they have agreed to act as one. Make sure that anyone you ask to be a reference has had a positive working relationship with you and is willing to help your job search. Once your reference has agreed  you will also want to give them an idea of the kinds of jobs you are seeking and your career goals. This way  your reference will be better prepared to describe your qualifications. For example  for a child care job or study pathway  your host parents can describe your au pair experience with them. If your new opportunity requires a certain level of English fluency  your English teacher can explain that. If you are a regular cluster meeting attendee  your Local Coordinator knows your strengths. If you need the letter to say anything specific  such as the dates of your employment or type of experience  be sure to let your reference know to include that information. To find out more and read somesample Reference Lettersvisitthebalancecareers.com. You might also considerasking for a recommendationvia LinkedIn if you are already a member. Now you know who au pairs can ask for letters of recommendation  you should also know it is best to ask for a recommendation letter several weeks in advance to allow your reference enough time to write it. The best recommendation letters usually take longer to write to allow your reference time to list all of your amazing accomplishments. Once your reference provides a letter of recommendation  don’t forget to call or send a note of thanks for their time. If your potential employer may need to follow up with your reference  keep them informed. Good luck in your future endeavors!

Why Do We Honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.?,On the third Monday of every January  we observe Martin Luther King Jr. Day. This is a day for the nation to reflect upon the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  a minister  civil rights activist and nonviolent leader. Dr. King was considered the most influential leader in the Civil Rights movement  which aimed to end the systematic racial segregation and discrimination against African Americans that plagued the country. Dr. King (often referred to as MLK) played a key role in creating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He received many awards and honors – most notably the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Dr. King was assassinated in 1968. Despite his early passing  Dr. King had enormous  lasting influence on the Civil Rights movement and continues to be remembered as one of the most influential nonviolent leaders in world history. Martin Luther King Jr. was born in Atlanta  Georgia  in 1929. As a boy  he attended legally segregated public schools  and graduated from high school at the age of 15. He obtained a B.A. from Morehouse College  attended the Crozer Theological Seminary for three years  and went on to earn his Ph.D. at Boston University. Following in his father’s and grandfather’s footsteps  he became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. As a minister Dr. King was always a strong advocate for equality  and worked toward civil rights equality. In 1955  he was recruited to serve as aleader for the Montgomery Bus Boycott. The Alabama city’s bus lines were segregated by race  and African Americans were forced to sit at the back of the bus. When a 42-year-old woman named Rosa Parks refused to give her seat to a white man  she was arrested and fined. Four days after this event African Americans around the city boycotted the bus service  often walking miles to work and suffering harrassment and intimidation along the way  for 381 days. As a result  the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in transportation was unconstitutional. Inspired by Gandhi’s success with nonviolent activism  Dr. King continued to organize nonviolent protests and civil disobedience as a way to fight for social change in Birmingham  Alabama  which was considered the “most segregated city in America” at the time. For example  “sit-ins” at racially segregated lunch counters and civil rights marches were organized. However  these efforts by the African-American community were often met with violence from the police. During a march  images of Birmingham police assaulting young African Americans with water hoses and dogs  injuring and bloodying them  sparked national outrage and a collective push for civil rights legislation. Dr. King was arrested  and it was during his time in prison that he drafted the “Letter from a Birmingham Jail ” in which he explained his theory of nonviolence. Dr. King was also instrumental in the 1963 March on Washington  in which more than 250 000 people demonstrated in the nation’s capital. It was here that Dr. King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech  in which he addressed the current situation and expressed his ideas of equality.Read this inspiring call to justice. In 1964  at the age of 35 Dr. King became the youngest person to ever win the Nobel Peace Prize. In the same year  Congress passed the Civil Rights Act. This act made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race in hiring  education  transportation  or any other sphere of public life. It also authorized the government to enforce desegregation  and outlawed segregation in any public place. Because segregation was so common  this act was extremely important. The March on Washington  along with the other movements in which Dr. King played a role  strongly influenced the passage of this act. One year later  in 1965  Congress passed theVoting Rights Act. Dr. King’s voting rights marches from Selma to Montgomery  Alabama  were influential in this passage. Toward the end of Dr. King’s life  he began to widen his focus to economic justice and international peace. He was tragically killed by a sniper outside of his motel room in Memphis  Tennessee  in 1968. Despite his early and untimely death  Dr. King’s tremendous accomplishments are remembered and celebrated. In 1994  Congress designated the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday as a national day of service. As a way to honor Dr. King’s tireless efforts in the pursuit of social justice  as well as to embrace his teachings on community service  the MLK Day of Service urges people of all ages and walks of life to “make it a day on  not a day off.” We encourage you to join in your community and participate in the MLK Day of Service!

Meet the 2019 Au Pair of the Year!,We’re thrilled to announce our 2019 Au Pair of the Year  Hagen Kamieth  from Siegen  Germany! The Moore family of Redmond  Washington  nominated Hagen who arrived to the U.S. in July and has been caring for their six-year-old daughter  Kira. Au Pair USA staff members across the U.S. voted for Hagen as our Au Pair of the Year! He’s embraced the role of au pair  big brother  family member  teacher  organizer  cultural ambassador  and friend during this time on the program. Hagen’s host family had this to say about him. “Our family nominates Hagen Kamieth for Au Pair of the Year! He has become a big brother to our 5-year old daughter and part of our family. Hagen quickly bonded with our daughter by learning about her interests and spending time playing with her. Hagen loves to play  which was a perfect fit for our daughter. He sends a photo nearly every day  which helps us feel involved even when we are at work. Our family is passionate about foreign languages and other cultures  and Hagen has done an excellent job sharing these with our family! Thanks to Hagen and our previous InterExchange au pairs  our daughter is fluent in German. He also shares holidays and family traditions with all of us. At the end of November  he surprised us with advent calendars! Our advent calendars were personalized for things we really love  which for us was a tea  hot sauce  and hello kitty calendar. Hagen made sure our daughter had a schultüte on her first day of Kindergarten! This is a cone filled with school supplies  candy  or toys which is given to children in Germany when they start school. Hagen also shares German language and culture as a volunteer preschool teacher at the Eastside German Language School on Saturdays. Hagen recently visited extended family with us in Wisconsin. Traveling with our daughter was so much easier with Hagen! He made sure she was entertained during the flight and helped care for her during the trip  including taking her snowshoeing. He even jumped in to help shovel the driveway during a winter snowstorm! Hagen has great relationships with our extended family  which really helps him feel like a member of the family. Hagen brings peace of mind to our family because we know he makes excellent decisions and is calm even in challenging situations. Because Hagen is such an excellent driver  we are comfortable with him taking longer trips with our daughter. In December  he took our daughter on a trip to ride THE POLAR EXPRESS™ train  which involved a two-hour drive in each direction. Hagen initiated  planned  and coordinated this activity to work with our daughter’s school break. Hagen has taught all of us some techniques to help us stay more organized and  most importantly  works with our daughter to make sure she’s learning to keep her things clean and organized. There has been a great deal of learning about our two cultures on both sides. Hagen’s little brother (age 8) and his mom will be visiting from Germany in April  and Hagen already has a number of activities planned and has asked to include our daughter.” We at InterExchange think Hagen is terrific  and we’re happy to name him our Au Pair of the Year!

Au Pairs: How to Have an Amazing Program Year,As an au pair  you’ve put in a lot of time getting ready for your program year. You’ve hadprep workto do before leaving your home country. Once you arrive to your host family  the learning continues. Here are a few tips for a successful program year. Spend that first weekend with your family getting to know them andestablishing your relationshipfor a successful year. Be open and honest if you don’t understand something – they can help you. If you feel any homesickness orculture shock  communicate that to your host family and Local Coordinator right away so they can help you through it. Most au pairs will need to get a driving license for their state – talk with your host family about this before arriving. Practice driving with your host family and then take your exam as soon as possible. Don’t wait until the grace period (usually 30-60 days) is up before you take the test. Understand that yourLocal Coordinator(LC) is here to support you and help you have a great program year. Always ask your LC for any advice or information. At the cluster meeting  your LC will give you contact information for au pairs in the cluster—reach out  they want to hear from you! There are also various Facebook pages dedicated to au pairs  including one for your area. Join the gym  check out your local library  and get to know the hot spots for a quick bite to eat or a cup of coffee and free Wi-Fi. Consider getting involved in your host child’s school or scout troop by offering to share something from your culture with their class. Volunteering is another way to get involved in your community. Immersing yourself is the best way to make the most of your au pair program. Try not to spend all day chatting with everyone back home. Be a part of your experience; it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity! Mary Beth was the InterExchange Au Pair USA Local Coordinator for the Chapel Hill area from 2010 to 2021.

Wrapping Up Your Au Pair Program,As you approach the end of your au pair program  there are several things to consider. The process for wrapping up your au pair program should be as thoughtful as the pre-arrival process. If you decide to extend for another 6  9 or 12 months  you must apply for an extension withinPassportat least45 daysbefore the end of your program year. Instructions and requirements can be found under the “Extension” tab within Passport. If you are extending your current placement  both au pairs and host parents must take action within Passport to submit the application. You will need to upload proof of completing the educational component  so gather up those documents first. As an au pairs  you will collect a lot of paperwork during the year. It may seem like you will never need these things again  but we never know where life will take us. Here is what you should always keep in a safe place: Mary Beth was the InterExchange Au Pair USA Local Coordinator for the Chapel Hill area from 2010 to 2021.

Celebrating the Holidays in the U.S.,Phew  we made it through Thanksgiving! Most American families celebrate Thanksgiving similarly: lots of food and family and friends  naps  and more food. With December upon us  it’s a good time for au pairs and host families to talk about the upcoming holidays and plan ahead. That’s one of the great things about exchange programs; everything is an opportunity for cultural exchange and December holidays  especially so! Be sure to talk about about your different holiday traditions and how you might be able to share those with each other. Many host families have young children and are building new family traditions along the way. Adding traditions from another country to your own is a way of continuing your exchange experience throughout the years. Sometimes  host families travel abroad over the holidays  and their au pair might be at home. Invite your au pair’s friends over for double the fun and exchange. It is also a busy time so be sure to discuss the au pair’s schedule in advance and set expectations. Some professions slow down in December during the holidays  and some get even busier. Try to strike a balance of work  social  and family fun time. It might be the case that your family will ask you to work on New Year’s Eve. This is always a night when it is difficult to find a babysitter. For au pairs  this might feel like “The Worst Night of the Year to Work.” If New Year’s Eve is a work night  talk about ways to make the night fun for everyone. And finally  if your shared holiday traditions include presents  remember that the best gifts are the ones that make us feel special and loved. Happy December!

Au Pair Maria Reflects on Her Year,The end of an au pair’s program year can be packed with mixed feelings. Au pair Maria  from Spain  ispreparing to return homeafter her program ends. She has been reflecting on her experience and lessons learned. “The Au Pair experience has been one of the most beautiful things I have ever done; I am so lucky to have an amazing host family. Together we have built a team to raise three awesome girls: one six and four-year-old twins. Being an Au Pair is challenging; you need to think ahead  be ready for every scenario you may face with the kids. You need to keep innovating and being creative with the activities. This may sound exhausting  but when you realize your kids are becoming intelligent  strong  kind young women  you know all of your efforts are totally worth it. Being an Au Pair has given me the confidence to look at myself as someone capable  independent  and mature. I am returning home happier than I have been in a long time! One thing I love about the Au Pair program is the possibilities it offers. I have made friends from all over the world  I have traveled around the USA  and I have gotten to know and live a very different culture. Now that my year is about to end  I can’t feel anything else but grateful.” Mary Beth was the InterExchange Au Pair USA Local Coordinator for the Chapel Hill area from 2010 to 2021.

Smoking and Vaping in the U.S. for Au Pairs,This blog was originally published in October 2019 and revised in September 2024 by other contributors. While smoking or vaping is technically not against the rules of the Au Pair program  it is frowned upon in American culture. Most host families do not allow smoking in their homes and will not hire an au pair who smokes  even socially (smoking or vaping only occasionally in social situations). Most au pairs understand the health risks of smoking  but may not have considered the impact it can have on their au pair program. Some host families may end a placement if they become aware that their au pair smokes  even socially. There are plenty of reasons not to smoke or vape  especially as an au pair. Here are some tips to help you avoid smoking. If you’re struggling not to smoke  it’s best to be honest and ask for help. Reach out to your host family orLocal Coordinatorand ask for their support. Au Pair USA wishes you a healthy and happy au pair program year  free of smoking and vaping.  Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange. She's lived across the U.S. and various countries around the world including the UK  Australia and Indonesia. She has a unique perspective on working and thriving in other cultures.

Una’s Journey From Au Pair Alumni to Tech Entrepreneur,Au pair alumni Una  from Bosnia  came to the U.S. as anau pairin 2012. At the time  her reasons for joining the au pair program were straightforward; she was a kindergarten teacher who wanted to experience teaching in a different culture while using English. Little did Una know that living abroad as an au pair would change the trajectory of her career and her life. Una’s au pair journey started with two host family placements  both of which didn’t work out. During this time of transition  Una stayed with herLocal CoordinatorRobin  who guided Una through the rematch process and was a great support to her. When Una’s second placement ended  it looked like she may have to return to Bosnia prematurely. But fate stepped in when Robin needed an au pair for her 12-year-old son. Robin invited Una to stay  and the perfect au pair and host family match was born. Una spent one and a half years in New Jersey with Robin  where she finally found the ideal au pair experience. She truly felt like a part of the family. During that time  Una’s English became increasingly fluent. Una explained  I had been learning English since I was eight. I already had all the knowledge in my head  but I had a hard time using it. Becoming an au pair helped me unleash that and gave me the confidence to speak in English. The growth didn’t stop there. Una also transformed as a person and developed skills that became crucial to her profession when she returned home. I gained the ability to adapt quickly  be flexible  and go with the flow. My host family’s needs were always changing  and I had to anticipate how to react and multitask. When Una’s time as an au pair came to a close  she walked away with much more than fond memories. Una had made relationships that would last a lifetime  become fluent in English  and overall matured as a young adult. Back in Bosnia  Una’s newfound skills immediately led to a job opportunity as an English teacher for preschoolers. Over the next three years  Una taught while gaining her Master’s in Psychology. During her program  Una met two other psychology students. The three of them started brainstorming how psychology could be applied in business. Una explained  In Bosnia  psychology is mostly used in schools  and we knew this field could offer more to today’s market. Human resources came to mind  and after some research  we identified the IT field. IT is a fast-growing industry  and these workers are under stress because they’re creating the present and the future. They don’t always have time to focus on their social skills. That’s where we decided to step in. After a few iterations and many long nights  Una and her co-founders launchedStressLess. The mission of StressLess is to use psychological tests and practices to improve recruitment  motivation  job satisfaction  and productivity with IT professionals in Bosnia. Una’s time in the U.S. and understanding of the American culture gave her a unique perspective on how to train workers in her home country so that they could effectively collaborate across borders. Many IT professionals in Bosnia work for American companies where they run into cross-cultural communication challenges. Because I lived in America  I knew how to advise these clients. For example  Americans like to show gratitude and often say ‘thank you’ in a working relationship  but Bosnians were confused as to why they were being thanked for simply doing their jobs. Demystifying these small cultural differences can increase productivity. Recently  StressLess’ concept was validated even more when Una was accepted to theYTILI Fellowship  a year-long program that creates a transatlantic dialogue on entrepreneurship between the U.S. and Europe. Una’s fellowship culminated in a trip to America  where she was able to connect with an old friend… Robin. Una shared  Over the past six years  it’s been really important for me to stay in touch with Robin. I’ve seen her twice since 2013  and now we’re not only family but really good friends. In addition to catching up with old friends  Una’s visit to the U.S. was an ideal time to reflect on her journey as an au pair. You become an au pair to test your limits and see what you can do. I’m no longer intimidated by the unfamiliar. In the end  theau pair programwas the inflection point that led Una to become the successful entrepreneur that she is today. With an international fellowship and thriving business under her belt  the future is bright. Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

Brazilian Au Pair Fernanda Leaves Her Comfort Zone Behind,Au pair Fernanda from Brazil has lived with her New Jersey host family for almost two years. Throughout her journey as an au pair  Fernanda has learned so much about herself. Here’s her au pair experience  in her own words. I decided to be an au pair mainly because I was always crazy about traveling abroad and improving my English in the United States. I decided to look for a type of cultural exchange that could suit me and found the au pair program. I was very nervous about what it would be like living with a family for at least a year that speaks a different language and lives in a different culture. It turned out very well after three months of adjustment. I think we need to be patient with ourselves and take some time to feel comfortable. It is normal to be afraid of leaving our comfort zone! My host family is lovely! What I like most about them is that they respect me and are always concerned about me  just like my family would be in Brazil. My host children are the love of my life… I love these three children with all my heart. I have LOTS of memories with them  but one that always makes me feel good is when I remember that on my birthday  they brought me breakfast in bed. One of the many things that surprised me as an au pair is how much patience I could develop over these two years! I learned how to handle difficult situations better. I learned a way to manage things that I never thought I could. I think homesickness is the hardest challenge to face. Being alone without someone you’ve always known is very difficult. I get over it by being open and making new friends. We need to do it here to survive! My advice to the other au pairs is basically to be open to a new culture  a new country  and a new you. Be ready and accept all the changes you will go through. You are ready to start the best moment of your life! Of course it will hurt some days  of course you will work hard  sometimes you may cry and wish for a different way. But there will be so many amazing moments  and you’ll be so thankful. Be open and fill your heart with all the courage in the world  and get on board! Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

Au Pair Taynan Calms the Chaos for This Working Parent,Meet host mom Dalya of San Diego! With two twin boys and a successful career  Dalya knows how chaotic yet wonderful life can be. As a busy parent  Dalya adores the consistency that the au pair program brings to her household  and she and her Brazilian “BroPair” pair Taynan make a solid team. Dalya shares a window into her life with an au pair. Au pair Taynan and his host boys. Image courtesy of Dayla As a single parent with two boys  life can be chaotic. Enter my au pair  Taynan. From the moment my boys met him at the airport  I could see they had an incredible connection and that he would be perfect for my boys. He has been the most amazing au pair  adding incredible value to both my life and my two little 6.5-year-old boys. He is incredibly loving  kind  patient  creative  and respectful and can share and teach these beautiful character traits to my boys. Having an au pair is like having another mature big brother or sister  adult role model  teacher  and caregiver in the home. No matter what stage my kids have been in  this additional loving adult helps to keep the home running smoothly  and the kids feeling loved and supported at all times. Taynan has brought his music  singing  and loving culture to my home  which has especially helped during times when my family needed calmness and peace. He pulls out his guitar and lulls my boys to sleep with songs from Brazil. He helps with every task to keep our home running smoothly  including supermarket shopping  finding new soccer sneakers  and getting my boys to their activities. Taynan has been a source of strength during trips to the hospital and has put plenty of bandaids on many booboos. Most of all  he is loving and kind and is another member of my family. Taynan has embraced my family  and in turn  we have included him in everything we do. Tay has shared his Portuguese with my boys  and now they love greeting him every day with “Tudo Bem?”  meaning “How are you?” My boys adore him  which makes my life better  and I can have some personal time away from home  knowing they are safe and loved. Having an au pair is the best decision any family can make  and I am so pleased that Au Pair USA has brought such an incredible person to my family and home!

An Au Pair’s Advice on Making Friends in the USA,Becoming an au pair in the USA will grow your independence. At the same time  creating new friendships is one of the best parts of the program. Au pair Tammy  from South Africa  excelled at forming relationships with fellow au pairs  Americans  and her Local Coordinator. Let’s hear her tips on how to make friends while in the U.S. My Local Coordinator  Ann  gave me the names and numbers of au pairs that she thought I’d have a lot in common with. She also asks all of her existing au pairs to welcome the new ones and show them around. That’s how I met Silke  who was an au pair who stayed for one year. Silke lived a five-minute walk from my house. She left and went to Belgium  but I still talk to her every day. She is visiting me in two weeks! I made a lot of American friends! I met my American friend  Justice  two months after I arrived. To this day  I still see him every weekend. With Justice came all of his friends. It wasn’t tough to make American friends. Everyone we’ve met and become friends with are pretty awesome people. Don’t be afraid to put yourself out there. Get out of your comfort zone. You’ll meet people at the weirdest places and end up having the best friendships ever. Friends are what get us through the lonely times. Just be yourself! I met Ann  my Local Coordinator  my first week in Virginia. She was extremely friendly. She made me feel comfortable and answered every question I had. Everything about her is so maternal. At cluster meetings  I always ask Ann questions to get to know her more. I ask her how she’s doing  how her kids are  does she have anything planned with her husband  or are they going away for the holidays  and so on. Ann always encourages us to try and do new things. She’s always telling you to explore and have fun. At cluster meetings  we talk about everything and anything. Many au pairs go to these meetings  but they don’t really say anything unless Ann asks them questions directly. I try to make sure at every cluster meeting to ask the other au pairs how they are doing and what their upcoming plans are. The advice I can give to anyone is to communicate. That’s how you build a good relationship with someone. Don’t be afraid to share who you are. I didn’t have to share anything with Ann  but I wanted to. I wanted her to know me  my character  and personality. That relationship helped me have a wonderful time as an au pair. Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

10 Airport Survival Tips to Keep Your Sanity This Summer,As an American expat living in Asia  I find myself on flights at least four times per month. Whether it’s a 90-minute hop or a 13-hour long haul across the Pacific  through trial and error I’ve created my travel routine to maintain my sanity throughout the journey. Summer is the season of family vacations and lots of exchange program travel  and I thought I’d share my go-to air travel survival tips with you! Before you leave the house  make sure you have your necessary travel documents including a government-issued photo ID and proof of your flight. I like to check my documents again once I’m in the car on the way to the airport… it gives me extra peace of mind! Nothing makes my stomach sink faster than realizing my carry-on or checked bag is too heavy! Fortunately  this is an avoidable situation. Check your airline’s baggage policy  then pack accordingly. Weigh your bags at home to give you total confidence. Airport and airplane temperatures can range from Antarctica to the Sahara Desert  making it wise to dress in layers. You may be sitting down for hours on end  so anticipate what will make you the most comfortable. I always carry a large but lightweight scarf because it can double as a blanket. Bring a few small snacks to avoid gettinghangryand to dodge crazy airport prices. If you’re traveling internationally  it’s best to finish all of your food before you land so that you don’t get hung up at customs. Another thing I always have is an empty water bottle  which I fill up after going through security. There’s nothing worse than starting a long trip only to be told the in-flight entertainment or wifi system is down. With today’s tech  it’s easy to come prepared by downloading your favorite movies to your tablet and phone before you leave home. E-readers are another option  as is having podcasts and music available offline. Don’t forget to store your chargers in your carry-on in case long delays wear down your batteries. Some airlines only accept cash while others only take cards  and you never know which one you’re going to get. Make it a point to have both cash and a credit or debit card available to ensure you can buy whatever snacks your heart desires. If you’ve got time to spare while waiting for your flight  make a plan for exactly when you’re going to head to your gate. I like to find my gate first  then explore the terminal. You can even set an alarm (or two!) on your phone in case you get caught up in the moment. Airports and airplanes can be loud and hectic  especially if you’re trying to catch some z’s. One way to combat this stressful environment? Have a ‘sleep’ playlist that’s saved offline on your device. Mine includes a few versions of white noise as well as meditation music. The reason to use hand sanitizer while traveling is obvious  but why make it scented? When food is served at 35 000 feet  the smell can be overwhelming. If you’re feeling a little green  put on your scented hand sanitizer and breath deep. I recommend this instead of lotions or perfumes  as you don’t want to overwhelm your fellow travelers in case they’re sensitive to scents. Travel can be stressful  but it can also be enjoyable if you let it. Being patient with your fellow sojourners and airline staff will improve your own experience. Remember that in the scheme of things a 15-minute delay is no big deal! If you’ve got a noisy patron nearby  put on your meditation playlist  and you’re good to go. And if a gate changes at the last minute  go with the flow and move on. There’s nothing you can do about it anyway! I hope you enjoyed reading my go-to travel tips! I’m sure you’ll come up with your own as you embark on your many adventures. Bon voyage! Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

I can’t even keep up with how many times someone told me how beautiful my hair is! Also  everything is so big! Not only the buildings and the houses  but also the holes in the doors of the toilet  the containers for your spices  and the meals you get in a restaurant. And I didn’t even mention Costco yet- the amount of food you can get there is literally insane! 12. Where is the favorite place you’ve been in the USA and why? New York City at Christmas time!

I just can’t go to New York without eating one. Definitely addicted! 14. Have you made friends in the USA? Yes  I have! I’m blessed that I have met some amazing people.

Do you have advice for other au pairs? Be yourself  love your job  and if you’re not happy  make a change. If it is a conversation  a change in your own behavior  or going into rematch  do what you have to do. A year is a long time if you’re not happy! Travel as much as you can. Keep continuing making new friends and get to know more people. 19. Do you have advice for host parents? Spend some time with your au pair to make him or her feel at home. Show them places to learn about typical American habits  food  holidays  etc. If your au pair is happy and is feeling appreciated it’s easier to stick around for a year and work hard. We do love kids a lot  but we also came to America to experience the country and the culture. 20. How do you think the au pair program has helped you grow as a person? It has helped me grow a lot  and I still am growing every single day. I know so much more about myself now  who I am and who I want to be  where I stand for what I really want in life  that I am how I am  and that I’m proud of who I have become. I learned to appreciate what I have back home and home looks so different now  so beautiful and so good. I had to face very difficult and hard situations alone  I had to travel alone  and that has given me so much confidence. 21. What is your favorite memory from being an au pair so far? I took a weekend class  and I was gone Saturday and Sunday from 7 am until 7 pm. When I came back home on Sunday one of my host kids came running to me. She screamed and jumped on me  started kissing and hugging me and then she told me that she missed me and she told me I love you! It melted my heart right away at that moment.

Foreign Language Teacher, Camp Counselor, and Au Pair Efim,The Rodov family  of New Jersey  were thrilled to welcome Russian au pair Efim into their household. Efim  age 25  has a Bachelor’s Degree in Foreign Languages which he’ll put to work by teaching children back in Russia after his time as an au pair concludes. Efim’s experience as a camp counselor has brought plenty of energy into his host family’s home. His host parents told us about their time together. We are a family of four and have been working with the au pair program for many years! This is the first year we’ve decided to invite a male au pair to our family to take care of our two boys and share memorable moments with us. Our son Simon is seven-years-old  and our son Elia just turned nine. Au pair Efim was in contact with us even before coming to the U.S. He wanted to understand our daily routines and learn more about the kids- their personalities  favorite foods  activities  and movies. The day Efim arrived at our house our kids got an older brother  a friend  an example to learn from  and a person who cares about them. At the same time  we got a good friend  a family member  a person who is there for us whenever we need him. Efim has a great personality and sense of humor  a can-do attitude; he’s always positive  creative  and responsible! The kids love playing sports with him or going to the park to get ice cream truck treats which is something special just between them and Efim. They love cooking and baking  the list of dishes is expanding as we speak… we love Efim’s apple pies! They also do creative projects like lego  building things with cardboard  and so many others. And at the same time  Efim takes household responsibilities seriously and makes sure our kids take it seriously too. He teaches them how to take care of themselves and each other  how to keep their room and house clean. Efim became a part of our family  and we are very touched that he loves to join us for the Shabbat family dinner when we light candles  say prayers  and share stories about the week  both our happy and sad moments. We are blessed to have him with us and hope he is enjoying this year in our family. Efim is the best au pair ever! Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

Faced with Cancer, Host Mom and Au Pair Partner in the Fight,Dr. Amy Chused is the type of superwoman you see in the movies. Not only is Amy an accomplished hospitalist  but she’s also a single mother to her three children  seven-year-old twins David and Elspeth and three-year-old Diana. As a single parent with a busy career and three kids  Amy’s time was scarce. And when her son David was diagnosed with cancer  everything changed. It was the steady and loving presence of their au pair Dulce that allowed the Chuseds to meet these difficult challenges head-on. Before the Chused family met Dulce  they were living in New York City with the three kids all sharing a bedroom. Space at home  free time  and finances were tighter than Amy would’ve liked. She knew she wanted more for her family than simply getting by. Ever the problem solver  Amy packed up their bags and moved her family to Maryland. The move meant leaving their longtime nanny behind  which presented a new challenge for Amy. “After the move to Maryland  I still needed childcare  but I have a wacky schedule that changes every month and even every week ” Amy said. “I needed somebody who could be flexible so that they could be on when I had to leave for work early  get the kids to school  and then pick them up later in the day. I needed a live-in  and I knew the au pair model could be a great fit.” Working with InterExchange Au Pair USA  Amy and the kids matched with Dulce  a Mexican au pair  and invited her to Maryland for a year-long stay. Dulce  age 27  is from a small town in northern Mexico. Before becoming an au pair  she worked with children for many years  including as a babysitter and in a rehabilitation center. Dulce decided to come to the U.S. as an au pair to embrace living in a country that was not her own. She knew this cultural exchange experience would push her to be more flexible  confident  and independent while also refining her English. Over the course of their time together  Amy and Dulce have become an unbreakable team. Amy quickly noticed a change in her work-life balance shortly after Dulce arrived. “Partnering with Dulce to care for my kids gives me an enormous amount of freedom ” Amy shared. “I used to have to rush home  take over the childcare  wrangle the kids to bed  work at the kitchen table  and squeeze in four hours of sleep. I was so unbelievably exhausted and it was not sustainable. “Hosting Dulce has hugely improved my rest because she helps with the kids’ morning and evening routines. I can trust her  and I know that the children are taken care of.” Eight months into Dulce’s au pair year  the Chuseds received news that no family wants to hear. David  Amy’s seven-year-old son  was diagnosed with cancer. Au pair Dulce stepped up in a truly incredible way so that Amy could focus on caring for David amongst long days in the hospital  chemotherapy  and a detailed care regime at home. “When David was so sick  Dulce truly acted as a member of the family ” Amy said. “I was able to spend a lot more time with David because I knew that Dulce was running the house with the girls. “My girls were moodier because they missed their mom  but Dulce was there for them. She even helped the girls video call with me  and she sent me plenty of photos of their adventures so that I could feel as close to them as possible.” After several tough months  David is on the road to recovery  and the family is taking things one step at a time. “Since the dust has settled  my kids and I are dealing with the emotional toll of David’s cancer. Dulce has been a huge support through all of that.” Dulce also reflected on how her relationship with the Chused family has transformed throughout this experience. “At the beginning of my year here  I was a stranger who was from a different country and culture ” Dulce said. “Over time and through these experiences  our relationship grew a lot. Now I truly feel like I’m a big sister to my host kids. When I’m with them  I know we are family  and we are all in it together. I really love them!” Dulce decided to stay with the Chuseds another six months and will be heading home to Mexico soon. She is walking away from her au pair experience with a new sense of confidence and a firm grasp of the English language  which she’ll be able to use to advance professionally in Mexico. Dulce’s not the only one who has grown over the past year and a half. “Dulce makes me a better doctor ” Amy reflected. “With her support of my hectic schedule  I have the freedom to practice medicine the way I want to be able to practice medicine.” “Even more  hosting Dulce has been a useful reminder for me to slow down. I tend to be solely focused on what I want for me and my kids. As a single mom by choice and a physician  I’m very driven. Having another adult in my home and working with her to provide the best care for my kids has helped me stay more conscious of other people’s needs.” It’s been a whirlwind 18 months for Dulce and the Chused family. Through it all  they prioritized communication  cultural understanding  and flexibility with one another. The result? One big  happy  and international family journeying through life the best way that they can. Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

Marie’s Journey from Office Assistant to Au Pair,Life takes unexpected turns  just ask au pair Marie from Germany! In her home country  Marie was an office assistant who also had a passion for spending time with kids. When the opportunity to be an au pair came along  she jumped at the chance! Now  Marie resides in the San Francisco area and looks after her two host kids  all while immersing herself in a new culture. Marie shared her au pair journey with us below. My name is Marie  I’m 23 years old  and I come from Thuringia  Germany. I’m doing the au pair program for one year. I’m an office assistant  but my passion is to travel the world and collect moments I’ll never forget. Before I was an au pair  it felt like something was missing. I was stuck in a life where I couldn’t move on. I decided to become an au pair when I read about the program online. Once I decided to join the program  I still had so many things to think about. The time flew by until my adventure began in September. After a farewell party with my friends and a tearful goodbye with my family at the airport  I arrived in New York City  but still  I couldn’t believe it! I was nervous until I met new people that were in the same situation as me. Two days of orientation  with people from all over the world! It was so much fun and a good start to a new chapter of my life. Now  I live in California with my host family. It’s a mix of Austria and Italy  and I love it! I take care of one boy and one girl  Jonah and Naomi. They are like my little brother and sister  super cute and lovely  very smart and respectful. We always have fun  and a good time together  I enjoy it a lot and appreciate it very much! My host parents are very friendly and take good care of me. Even at the beginning when it was hard for me  because of the language  they helped me in every situation. Now  we laugh together and talk all the time. We became good friends  and I’m very thankful for everything. I’m a part of the family now  and I’m so happy about it! I travel a lot with my family and friends. I did a road trip through Florida  from Miami to Orlando. I went skiing in Mt. Shasta  but my favorite trip was to Disneyland! And there are still many plans coming up like going to Coachella and two road trips through California to the Grand Canyon. My whole life  I had the dream to live in a different country with another culture and a different language. Now my dream came true! I’d definitely recommend this experience to another person. I hope they will always have a good experience like me. I know that wherever I go  I will never be completely at home again because part of my heart will always be here in San Francisco! Let your dreams come true and believe in yourself! Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

Japanese Au Pair Misaki Practices the Art of Daily Positivity,First-time parents Scottie and Ree love to slow down and enjoy the little things in life. When it came time to find an au pair for their daughter  Amilea  they knew they needed someone with the same family philosophy. Enter au pair Misaki from Japan. During her time in the U.S.  Misaki has been able to balance looking after Amilea while also practicing self-care. Misaki’s host parents reflected on their time with Misaki so far  sharing Misaki’s great example of how to implement daily positivity. At the beginning of Misaki’s shift  she greets us with a smile and says  “Ohayo Gozaimasu!” which is Good Morning in Japanese. Our baby  Amilea always looks back with happiness and excitement to see where Misaki is  which is usually standing at the bottom of the stairs. Smiles are exchanged around our dining table – this is how we start our day. Misaki is independent and explores the different Seattle neighborhoods with walking or using public transportation  often with Amilea in our baby carrier. Their daily adventures allow them to explore new things in this thriving Pacific Northwest city and stimulate each of their well-being. Amilea loves being outside with Misaki – she admires the flowers  smells the salt air off the Puget Sound and listens to the street sounds as she gazes at dog walkers and fellow pedestrians. In the comfort of the baby carrier  Amilea can observe life outside of our home in a safe  comfortable way. We believe that this helps the development of Amilea’s senses  emotions  and overall happiness and are very thankful for their daily adventures. Misaki has fulfilled her promise of sharing her Japanese heritage and culture with Amilea. Twice a week  they stop by the Asian public library to check out Japanese books to bring home. Misaki has story time with Amilea and recites it all back to her in Japanese. At seven months  Amilea probably won’t understand any of the exact meaning  but we think to immerse her will give her a head start and will be her foundation as she grows into a little girl. We feel Misaki goes well beyond what’s asked. We can tell she genuinely cares for Amilea and does it from the goodness of her heart. There are numerous reasons why this is a one-of-a-kind pairing for our family. The thing that stands above the rest is Misaki’s happiness and her enjoyment in life. Misaki maximizes her American experiences by: We believe in order to make others happy  you must be happy yourself. Misaki graciously shares her happiness and positivity with Amilea and us. We know Misaki will move on once her year contract is up. We wish we could stop time since we’re dreading the day she’s no longer part of our family. Misaki’s stories will be legendary to Amilea and quite possibly to future au pairs in our home. All of us will miss her very much  but her memory will forever be with us since we’re all touched with Misaki’s grace. Misaki  the foundation you have provided us will be priceless as we all grow older. Thank you  Misaki for being you! Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

Advice on Living Abroad From Au Pair Orientation Manager Amber,Meet Amber  InterExchange AuPairUSA’s Orientation Manager! Prior to joining InterExchange  Amber lived in Japan for six years which gave her many amazing stories to tell. We asked Amber to share her experiences with us and also picked her brain about the advice she has for host families and au pairs based on her time living abroad. I grew up in Florida and went to college in Orlando where I often ventured to Disney World with friends  sometimes even just for dinner. “Let’s have dinner in Norway ” was a common phrase in my life! I first starting thinking about global explorations when I was an RA (Resident Assistant) in college. One year  I was the RA for the international floor where our international exchange students were housed. It was so much fun getting to know people from all over  eating all different kinds of food  and learning a few language phrases here and there. I have a degree in Film Production  and I interned at FUNimation for a summer  the largest US dubbing and DVD distribution company for anime. I was obsessed with anime  and I was looking to make it my final career goal to work in the industry. I thought it might not be a bad idea to go over to Japan for one year to see where anime comes from and see first hand the culture it portrays. While I was in Japan  I worked for an international school in Tokyo… and one year became six. I fell in love with the country  and I say country because I didn’t start in Tokyo. I was in a school for a year in Sendai  then a year in Kanazawa  before I switched to the International School in Tokyo for the final four years. My time at the International School reignited my love of being surrounded by an international community  and it also made me realize that I have a love of teaching. While I was at the school  I was the English Language Support Instructor for K1 (3 and 4 year-olds)  as well as the LEAP Coordinator (the before/after school study and tutor program). It was very hard to leave  as I had made a life there  some lifelong friends  and felt like I was leaving an entire life behind me. I still go through times when I miss Japan so much  but I’m very happy to be back in my home country as well. The best part is a toss-up between the food and the traveling I did. I visited over 15 cities  including spending New Year’s in Kyoto which was beyond incredible  and a week in Nikko which was truly sublime  so gorgeous. I love traveling  and there was so much to see in Japan for many reasons  from historical to fun to bizarre. The most challenging thing I’d have to say is again a toss-up between the language barrier and homesickness. Japanese has three writing styles and several levels of speech  so it was very difficult for the first year or so. But once I learned a few key phrases  it became much easier. I really struggled with homesickness for a good six months. It was very difficult  most especially around the holidays  which is why I went traveling as much as I could to get my mind off of it. The main lessons I learned were definitely to be very open-minded and patient. Dealing with people from all over  it’s very easy to forget that someone is not actually being rude  it’s just that in their culture  they are used to speaking bluntly. Or even the opposite  having to tease apart someone’s words to get to their point because their culture believes in not speaking in a direct manner. I think some of my most cherished experiences were the New Year’s celebrations at my international school when they would bring professional sumo wrestlers to the school to help the children pound mochi and wrestle with the children and teachers alike. As well as their Fall Festival which was so much like American Halloween  it was amazing. Oh  and their DEAR festival (Drop Everything And Read) in which everyone dresses up as their favorite book character for a day. And Culture Day  when everyone dresses up in their culture’s traditional garb and we all discuss where we all come from. So amazing! So much. I love being able to see and speak with people from all over. It’s always a different experience  which I really enjoy. I also love how at the beginning  everyone is wide-eyed and unsure and eager but also a little terrified. Then after I speak with the au pairs for a few days and explain everything  try to make them laugh a bit  and help them better understand the culture they have just suddenly found themselves in  they always leave with a look of assuredness and excitement. I absolutely love that. Be patient and open-minded with your au pair. That’s the most important thing. Living overseas away from your own family and friends for any amount of time is very difficult. And be aware that they are interested in sharing their culture with you if you let them. These au pairs only know of American culture what they have seen on TV and in movies  which I can guarantee you is not all we are. I remember being in Japan and seeing news reports and documentaries about only our most bizarre and worst parts. It really made me sad to think that this is all the world gets to see. So I did what I could to share my culture with those who were open and curious. In the same way  show your au pair what it really means to be an American in America. If there is an event  festival  or historical site that your area is known for  definitely bring them along and show them our real culture. Don’t forget the fact that these young people are coming from a culture that you have very limited knowledge about. Ask lots of questions  like what their traditional meals are or how to celebrate certain holidays they have from their home country. Let them share their culture with you. Above all  be patient with yourself. It’s a very scary thing to uproot yourself and be thrown into the deep-end of another culture. Don’t let it intimidate you! One of my favorite quotes is by author Mandy Hale  “It’s okay to be scared. Being scared means you’re about to do something very  very brave.” I can’t express how true to life this is. But don’t just stop at  ‘Okay  I’m brave just by being here.’ Yes  you are  but why not take it a step further? A rule I had for myself for my first year in Japan was every new experience presented to me  I said ‘YES.’ Mind you  there was that little voice in the back of my head that said ‘But new things are scary…’ I just told that voice ‘All the more reason to do it.’ And I have so many incredible memories to prove it. In closing  if I can live abroad  anyone can do it! We at InterExchange are here with you  both host families and au pairs  to support you every step of the way. We want you all to have an amazing experience to walk away with  just as all of us at InterExchange have had done for us. Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

Valentine’s Day in the USA,Have you been seeing red and pink hearts  stuffed animals  and chocolates everywhere you go? It’s that time of the year – Valentine’s Day is upon us! Every year on February 14th  couples celebrate their relationships  children trade cards and candies with friends  family members exchange greetings  and single people plan alternative events in rebellion. Valentine’s Day  much like many other holidays here in the United States  is a time for gifts and food! Every year  $18 billion dollars are spent on celebrating the holiday in the USA alone. The most commonly gifted items are candy  flowers  cards  jewelry  and dining out. If you’re planning to give a valentine gift  boxes of chocolates are popular choices. For a different alternative  you can try conversation hearts  which are small  sugary heart-shaped candies bearing messages such as “Be Mine” and “Cutie Pie.” Valentine’s Day can also be a great day for children! Your host children will most likely want to distribute valentines  which are small cards  to their classmates and other friends at school. Valentines featuring beloved cartoon characters and other fun designs are available for purchase at many stores  but we love the idea of children creating their own for their parents  classmates  friends  and au pairs! Making valentine cards can be a great way for you to bond with your host children and to inspire their creativity. When you’re talking with your friends instead of your host children  some of them might experience some stress about this day. Valentine’s Day can take extra energy – both for people who are in relationships and those who are not. People who are in relationships may find themselves worrying about whether or not their loved one will like the gifts and activities that they have planned. Single people sometimes feel excluded when the emphasis is on couples during this celebration of romantic love. We at InterExchange Au Pair USA encourage you to avoid any stressful thoughts regarding Valentine’s Day and to focus on the positive relationships you have in your life. Regardless of whether or not you have a valentine  make it an opportunity to reach out to your family and friends in your home country  your Local Coordinator  and your host family and friends here in the U.S. We’re sure that you’re missed by people at home and loved by people here in the USA  and it’s always good to remind everyone in your life how much you care about them.

Winter Driving Safety Tips for Au Pairs,Looks like it’s going to be a long winter! The snow is coming down heavily across most of the country  and it’s an important time to prepare yourself for driving on snow and ice. Follow these tips to keep yourself safe when the roads are bad. Before you drive in winter weather or snow  talk to your host parents. Every car and climate is different  so you’ll need to ask them about your specific situation. If you’re not yet comfortable driving in snow  let your host parents know and ask them to teach you what to do. They’ll be happy to see you prioritizing safety and communication! Your Local Coordinator will also be glad to help. Don’t hesitate to reach out to them for their advice and support. Driving too fast is the easiest way to lose control of your car in winter weather. In normal conditions  you should have a distance of three seconds between you and the car in front of you. In the winter  you should increase that distance to a full eight to 10 seconds. Yes  that does mean you have to give yourself extra time to get around  but you and your host family will be a lot safer for it. Ice and snow can cause your vehicle to slide and skid  even if you’re driving safely. If you start to skid  always remain calm and follow these steps: Always clear all snow off of your car so that others can see you – that includes the roof! Keep a large broom in the trunk of your car to easily remove large amounts of snow. Turn on both front and rear defrosters to soften the ice before scraping the windows completely clear. Also  check your tailpipe to make sure it’s snow-free. Warming up your car in a garage causes carbon monoxide to build up. Carbon monoxide is very dangerous  especially because you can’t see it or smell it. This means you should never warm up your car in an enclosed space. Your car should have a safety kit in it  no matter what time of year it is. Some items to include are jumper cables  a flashlight  water  food  snacks  and a phone charger. In the winter  make sure you have a snow scraper and blankets too. The key to a safe winter for au pairs and host families is driving slowly and carefully. Take your time and don’t be afraid to ask for help. We hope you have a wonderful winter season! Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

Gabi From Brazil Talks About Her Life as an Au Pair,Au pair Gabi  based in New Jersey  has been in the USA for over one year and is loving every minute of it! We asked Gabi to tell us about her au pair journey including what her typical day is like and the advice she has for other au pairs. My name is Gabriela but here in the U.S.  it’s easier to call me Gabi. I’m 22 years old  my 21st birthday was one week before I came to the USA. It was a really good way to start another year of my life! I’m from Curitiba  a city in the south of Brazil. Curitiba is the coldest capital in the country  which means that Brazil is not hot everywhere like a lot of people think! I decided to become an au pair to travel the world  know new cultures  and challenge myself. I discovered the au pair program and it had everything I wanted because I’ve always had an awesome relationship with children. I also wanted to learn more English. I wanted to live with an American family for one year so I could enjoy all the seasons and special moments that only happen when you are here in the USA. Before I came to the U.S. I spent one year just looking for information and experiences of other au pairs because I wanted to be aware of all the things that could happen to me. All this research brought me to a point where I learned a lot about the au pair program but it wasn’t easy to find all the information that I needed  and the au pair program is not easy either. So now I do everything I can to help au pairs have the most amazing experience. I always try to make the new au pairs feel welcome where I live. Having friends here is something we need  having someone to talk to and feel unburdened with is exceptional. My typical day as an au pair starts at 7 a.m. helping the kids get ready for school. I wake them up  prepare their breakfast  and make lunch. Then we take a 10-minute walk to school. After I drop off the kids I make the beds  organize the things from the morning  and then I have my free time. My break goes from 9 a.m. to 2:50 p.m. when I need to pick up my younger kid. We walk back home and I drive them to activities like soccer  Hebrew school  and basketball. After that  I help with the dinner. The whole family always has dinner together and once we clean up I’m done for the day. I love my host family because since the first time we talked on Skype I felt like I’ve known them for a long time. They make me feel comfortable and they include me as part of the family in their activities. I’ve built a strong relationship with the kids  I don’t want to think about how it’s going to be to leave them. My advice for other au pairs is to calm down  you don’t need to rush to find a family  don’t need to fly to another country in the next day  the things will happen when they need to be. Sometimes we are waiting for more than we should  so just live one moment at each time and learn to enjoy the little things that happen in your life. You’re gonna grow here as you never imagined. Life is full of surprises so enjoy every single moment! Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

Au Pairs Have Fun In Philadelphia,From rich American history to delicious cheesesteaks  there are plenty of reasons to love Philadelphia! Our au pairs recently had a fun day out in Philly. We asked Local Coordinator Tracy to tell us all about it. Where did you explore with the au pairs? We went to the Philadelphia Art Museum. Many of our au pairs enjoy touring museums  and this is a great place to view gorgeous works of art. The first Sunday of the month is free  and we were able to view famous works by Monet and Vincent van Gogh. There was also a fashion exhibit on display which was enjoyable for our many fashionistas in the group. After touring the museum  we went out front to run the very same steps that Sylvester Stallone ran in the movie Rocky! Then we walked around to the back of the museum to view the Schuylkill River and Boathouse Row. It’s a beautiful view where you can picnic along the lawn and watch the crew teams go up and down the water. What did the au pairs enjoy the most? It’s not very often we get to visit a museum  and I think the au pairs enjoyed doing something different. Some had never been inside the museum and didn’t even know what it was  though they had passed it in the city a number of times. They also really liked seeing a landmark that was pictured in a famous movie. A few of the au pairs had never seen Rocky and were told to do so when they got home! Why do au pairs enjoy living in the Philadelphia area? It’s very central to everything  especially if you like to travel. You aren’t too far from the beach  the suburbs  or the farmlands of Pennsylvania. Just about anything you want to do around Philadelphia can be done on a simple day trip. By train or car  you can get to major cities like NYC and D.C. in a few short hours. What makes Philadelphia a unique place for au pairs to experience? There is so much to see and do. It’s not too overwhelming like some of the bigger cities. It’s a very inviting and walkable city  filled with important American history like the Liberty Bell  National Constitution Center  and Independence Hall. There are always different festivals for au pairs to attend and learn about different cultures. One is never bored in Philly! Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

Meet the 2018 InterExchange Au Pair of the Year!,We’re thrilled to announce our 2018 Au Pair of the Year  Alyz Hidalgo Abarca from Costa Rica! Alyz lives in Arlington  VA with the Landis family where she cares for an adorable baby boy who is almost two-years-old. Au pair Alyz has become an invaluable partner to her host parents. Here’s what Alyz’s host mom  Christina  had to say. I nominate Alyz Hidalgo Abarca for the Au Pair of the Year award. I nominate Alyz because of the exceptional way she cared for my infant son  and how she balanced work and life. When I returned to work  I worried about missing important milestones. Alyz sent text and photo messages so I would not miss a moment… the photographer. Alyz was receptive to my decision to breastfeed and provided support and guidance about milk storage. When my son was starting his first foods  Alyz made suggestions for food choices. She even cooked his first meals… the chef. As a first parent  I was figuring things out as I went. As I read books or articles  I introduced new ways to try to get my son to sleep longer and to eat better. Alyz was flexible with changes in routines… the adaptable caregiver. Two months after Alyz’s arrival  my father passed away. At the funeral services  Alyz reacted to cues  even ones I didn’t know I was giving  and knew when to step in. It was almost like a dance; she knew when I needed my baby’s cuddles and when I needed time to myself… the mind reader. Alyz volunteered in the community and joined the Medical Reserve Corps. During her time with the Corps  Alyz used her bilingual skills to assist residents with completing forms during a community flu clinic. She also volunteered at the area food bank… the community volunteer. Alyz was someone who set goals and that was no different when planning her time off. She created lists of destinations she wanted to visit during her time in the United States. She made great progress in checking off locations  including stepping foot in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans… the sightseer. Cultural exchange was not only one way. Alyz sought opportunities for my son and me to interact with her Costa Rican culture beyond sharing recipes for Gallo Pinto and Torta Chilena. When absentee voting for the Costa Rican elections was occurring  we traveled to the embassy in Washington  DC. When Costa Rica was playing in the World Cup  we went to the Costa Rican Association’s watch party. On Costa Rican holidays  Alyz shared the meaning behind the days… the educator. In the early days when tracking bottle feeding  wet and dirty diapers  and nap time was necessary… the scheduler. When I could not figure out baby babble… the translator. When my son began to learn his first words  in Spanish and English… the teacher. When teething started… the cuddler. When my son needed to shake off his tears and would need someone willing to do anything to get a laugh… the comic. When the time came that it was no longer necessary to track diapers  sleep time… the reminder to me to let things go and have fun! Congratulations  Alyz! We are so proud of you.

Lucas From Brazil Shares Snapshots Of His Au Pair Year,Au pair Lucas from Brazil has had an unforgettable time with his New Jersey host family. As a photographer  Lucas has captured his au pair year in a truly unique way. He shares some of his favorite snapshots with us below. My name is Lucas  I’m 24  and I’m from Sao Paulo  Brazil. I’ve been doing the au pair program for one year and eight months. I’m a photographer and web designer  and I’ve always been passionate to capture moments  places  people  and happiness! I decided to be an au pair because  at some point in my life  I needed something  a fresh start. I heard about the program because a friend of mine was an au pair before  and I thought it would be a great experience  especially because I’m an adventurous person who loves challenges. Once I decided to become an au pair  I had a long time to prepare myself  but the time flew by. I had a lot of farewells and I was totally sure that I was going to miss my culture and my time with my friends and my family. I left for the USA during my birthday. It was such a great gift to have the opportunity to start a new phase with a new year of my life. My biggest challenge was my English because even though I knew enough to understand and communicate  it’s different when you’re totally immersed. You have to work hard and give your best. Thankfully  it didn’t take much time to get used to it. My orientation week in New York City was really nice  I met people from different parts of the world. InterExchange made sure I was safe  comfortable  and that I had a good time. Now  I live in New Jersey with my host family. It’s totally different from where I live in Brazil. Sao Paulo is kind of like New York  but everything here in New Jersey is calm. I take care of two boys  Brody and Zach. They’re awesome host kids. They are respectful  smart  funny  and we always have a great time. I’m so thankful to be part of a family that really cares about me ever since the beginning of our match. They always asked me how I felt and if I need anything. They made sure to take it easy at the beginning  because they know how hard it is being alone in another country  far away from my family  speaking a language that is not native to me. They made sure I was going to have a good time and experience. My host family is really nice  they make me feel that I’m part of the family  and they also respect my personal life and time. I can’t explain with words how I felt going to places that I always dreamed of or that I watched in movies and never imagined that I could go. During my time as an au pair  I’ve traveled a lot by myself  with friends  and with my host family. My favorite was my road trip from San Francisco to Yosemite Park  the Grand Canyon  Las Vegas  Los Angeles  Hollywood  and Santa Monica. I also met a group of friends and we drove from Nashville and went to Atlanta  Louisiana  Alabama  and Texas. I’d definitely recommend this experience to another person. And I hope they will always have as good of an experience as I have. I’ve grown up in a way that I can’t explain  and I know that now wherever I go my heart is always going to be divided because of my care for my host kids. Always believe in your dreams!

Meet Au Pair Nasrene from South Africa,Nasrene has spent two fabulous years in the USA as an au pair and has truly made the most of her time here. Not only has she explored much of the country  but she also enjoyed her experience with her host children so much that she’s decided to change careers upon returning home to South Africa. Nasrene tells us all about it in her own words below. I’m Nasrene from Johannesburg  South Africa. I arrived as an au pair in New Jersey in November 2016. I had just graduated from a Bachelor’s degree in Marketing back home and wanted the opportunity to travel by myself before entering the corporate world. I was a nanny while studying so I had the passion and experience to be a good candidate for the au pair program. I have always been an independent and strong-willed individual so it was no surprise to my family and friends when I said I wanted to move to the U.S. and participate in the au pair program. Leaving was a true eye-opener for me  so many people came to wish me well and support me on my journey. My family and close friends were all very excited for me  and at the time were very excited at the opportunity to come to visit me which has now become a reality! My mom  younger sister  and a close friend visited me in New Jersey in 2016. This year  my mom came to hang out with me in San Francisco. I spent my first year in New Jersey with a great family with three fun-filled boys. I had an amazing year with them and we had a very special bond  they will always be my family and New Jersey will always be my home in America. For my second year  I decided I would like to see more of the country so I extended with a new family that at the time was based in New York but then moved to San Francisco. I now look after a one-year-old baby girl whom I love! We still travel back to New York fairly often and it has been fun to bring the two families together. Over the summer we stayed in Brooklyn  and my New Jersey family came to hang out with us. Besides looking after the wonderful kids  the au pair program has allowed me to travel so much! I have been lucky to travel a lot with my families- my first family even got me to be pretty decent at skiing which is something I had never tried before. I spent my 24th birthday learning to ski which is one of my best memories here. Some of my other favorite experiences have been New York  Disneyland  Niagara Falls  Hawaii and driving down the 101 with my mom from San Francisco to Los Angeles. I’ve learned a lot about myself as an au pair. So much  that I will never see the corporate world… I plan to study nursing and pursue a career in pediatric nursing! I realized that I will never be happy in a career that doesn’t involve kids and that isn’t fulfilling on a very personal level. It also made me think about what I want for my future and the steps that I need to take in order to get there. Before coming here I wasn’t that crazy about traveling but now I guess I’ve experienced what they call ‘Wanderlust.’ I definitely plan to see every continent!

Au Pair Asks Host Mom to Be Her Maid of Honor,Au pair Elisabeth and her host mom Jackie have an incredibly unique bond. Elisabeth joined Jackie’s household as an au pair in 2012 and has visited her former host family every year since! Recently  Elisabeth had a very special question for her former host mom. Au pair Elisabeth shared their sweet story in her own words. Hi! My name is Elisabeth  most people call me Lis  and I’m from Belgium. In 2012  I became an au pair. I decided to become an au pair because I love traveling  different cultures  and kids. I was craving an adventure abroad  but I didn’t have much money. At one moment  I read an article in a Dutch magazine about being an au pair  and immediately I knew it was something that I wanted to do. The combination of working with kids and experiencing a different culture was really attractive to me. I arrived at my host family’s home in New York in 2012 when I was 20 years old and up until now  we are still very close. My favorite part of being an au pair was definitely the love and warmth that I got from my family. I loved the freedom that my host parents  Mike and Jackie  gave me to do some awesome activities with the kids. Mike and Jackie treated me as their own child and made me feel like home. I lived with them  I was part of the family  and they made me feel that way. At the end of my program  I was having a really hard time. It was time to go back to Belgium  but my two years with them as an au pair were the best years I’ve ever had. I would miss them so much. When I got back home in July of 2013  I started studying at the University of Leuven. Now  five years later  I graduated as a psychologist. In line with my au pair experience  I am applying for jobs where I can still work with kids! Being an au pair helped me decide to become a psychologist. A lot of credit should go to my host family  as they taught me life lessons that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. During my studies  I still missed Jackie and my host family so much. Ever since 2013  for six years I’ve been visiting them every single year  sometimes twice a year! Three and a half years ago I met the love of my life. Actually  I met him 20 years ago  but it took us 16 years to figure out we’re meant for each other! Last May he proposed  and I knew I had to have my host family involved in my wedding. This year  when I went to visit my host family  I came along with a special present for Jackie. I asked her to be the maid of honor at my wedding! I’m glad she said yes! When I asked Jackie to be my maid of honor  she was emotional and very surprised. It was a really special moment and she had the biggest smile on her face. It’ll be the first time my entire host family will come and visit me in Belgium. I can’t wait to have them with me on my wedding day! One huge life lesson I learned as an au pair is that you will never be completely home again because part of your heart will always be elsewhere. That’s the price you pay for the richness of loving people in more than one place. Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

Au Pair Alumni Adrian Takes Off On His Next Adventure,Meet au pair alumni Adrian from South Africa! Adrian was an au pair in the USA from 2016 to 2018 and now he’s taking off on his next adventure of working his dream job. Check out his story below. Hi  I’m Adrian. I’m 26 years old and before I moved to the United States in 2016  I had never traveled overseas. I was born and raised in East London which is a small town in South Africa. I lived there for 21 years before moving to Cape Town in 2014 to pursue my Bachelor of Education degree. However  I only completed the first year of the degree. Whilst living in Cape Town  I worked three jobs. The first was a half-day personal assistant to the proprietor for a law firm  the second was as an afternoon au pair/manny  and the third was being a waiter on the evenings and weekends. My housemate helped me realize that I was too young to be ‘stuck’ living the same day in and out  and I realized I had the experience needed to apply to be an au pair in the USA! I had heard of many au pairs going to America to improve their English or travel the U.S. but for me  it was about the chance to gain international life experience  to be able to save towards my future endeavors and to live a new life with an American family. I also loved the idea of getting away and having somewhat of a break from the hustle and bustle of adulting! It’s difficult to mention only one favorite part of my au pair time. I was an au pair for 21 months and I really enjoyed making friends from all over the world! Never had I imagined the opportunity to meet many different nationalities. My closest friends were from all parts of the globe including France  Germany  Ecuador  and Austria! I also loved the fact that I was an hour away from New York City and could explore a new part of the beautiful Concrete Jungle every weekend. I was extremely fortunate to attend many concerts: Lady Gaga  Kesha  Katy Perry  Charli XCX  Terror Jr  Betty Who  Astrid S  Rita Ora  Noah Cyrus  and Panic! at the Disco. There were also many international DJs I danced the night away to like Robin Schulz  Klingande  Autograf  Elderbrook  and Hayden James. I knew that after my time as an au pair in the U.S. I would never be able to settle for a normal job in South Africa. I have a personal motto that I follow  and it’s tonever conform to normality.I have worked an office job before and never enjoyed it. I have worked in law firms before and couldn’t wait for 5 pm to get out. I have worked three jobs at once and exhausted myself. So I knew that once my visa expired  I wanted to start a new journey that would excite me and not cause me to live a mediocre life. Even before starting my au pair journey in the U.S. in 2016  I had thought of joining Emirates  but knew I was not mature enough and did not have the international experience. My time in the U.S.helped me mature  develop  and become very optimistic  become culturally aware  learn how to deal with living and working abroad  learn how to cope with culture shock  and learn how to handle homesickness! And honestly  walking the streets of New York City every week inspired me to reach my wildest dreams! It allowed me to believe in myself and turn my dreams into reality! I was so excited when I got an interview with Emirates. I will NEVER forget this surreal moment. Here I was  a South African from little East London  dressed in a suit and tie  riding in a yellow cab taxi through New York City to a hotel in Times Square to go and attend an interview to move to Dubai and work for Emirates! How bizarre!? Out of 191 candidates at the recruitment day  only 11 were selected  of which four of us were au pairs. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that happening. But it did  and I landed a dream job! After living in the United States for 22 months  I returned to South Africa for 16 days and then moved to Dubai at the end of September 2018. Now that I’m in Dubai  I have several weeks of training to attend before I start working flights. Emirates operates to 150 destinations in 80 different countries across 6 continents. I will be exploring the whole world and learning about many different cultures and nationalities. I cannot wait to work on flights and assist worldwide customers whilst working with many nationalities of cabin crew. I’ll also get to explore new cities during layovers. I am determined to make a career out of this opportunity and grow within Emirates. The au pair program is an opportunity you need to grab with both hands! It’s an amazing experience to make friends from all over the world  gain an American family  obtain international life experience  and travel across the United States. I  unfortunately  did not travel much in the U.S. as I decided to save  but life has rewarded me with the opportunity to now travel around the whole world. I’ll end by saying leave your comfort zone and don’t be afraid of change. Life will reward you immensely! Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

Au Pair Laura’s Epic Road Trip in the USA,At the end of your au pair year  you receive one month to travel all around the USA before going back to your home country. Au pair Laura  from France  took that time to go on an epic road trip! Laura shared some photos below as well as some smart tips on how to have a successful road trip. My host family was so happy for me to start my new amazing adventure. I felt loved by my two baby girls and their parents. I loved the way they helped me to be ready and had everything I needed for my fabulous month-long road trip in the western U.S. I had saved money for two years for the trip and decided not to buy any luxury stuff like restaurants or fast food. I put a mattress in my rental car  planned to take showers at the YMCA  and off I went! I stopped at the Badlands and the Petrified Forest National Park  this purple mud was amazing! I took a hike down and I felt like I understood many  many things about our planet and its history. Nature is wonderful  magical. You drive not that much and you find totally different lands. I passed by the mystic Route 66 too. Next was the famous Antelope Canyon in Arizona. It is the property of the Native Americans and you must be careful because if it’s raining miles away  there is a risk of flash flood. It was a wonderful but fast experience because so many people were there too. Did you know the highest point in Bryce Canyon is around 9 000 feet or 2 500 meters? Crazy  you would never think. That’s why I decided I didn’t want to stay the night there. It was going to be so cold. I did many hikes down the beautiful  majestic canyon and drove up to Utah because a snow storm was coming my way. I stopped by a restaurant in the middle of nowhere  asked for hot water for my instant noodles and I slept in the van in the parking lot while the snow was falling. I got back on the road the morning after. In Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado  I saw wonderful Native American constructions in the rocks from many years ago. So impressive and talented! Nature is powerful! I only hiked two miles along the Grand Canyon but it is so enormous! By now  I’d seen many canyons already but the Grand Canyon is so GRAND! I want to come back and hike down the canyon to camp there. For sure  I’ll come back. I slept in Grand Canyon National Park and was the first to wake up. Zion National Park is so impressive! I wish I had more time to visit it all. I went on many crazy beautiful hikes and had the perfect temperature for hiking. Thanks  Mother Nature! I stopped at Malibu Beach from one of the TV shows I watched for many years with my siblings. I didn’t see Pamela Anderson  but I got funny pictures. I arrived at night in San Francisco and ate dinner in front of the Golden Gate bridge. I really felt in love with San Francisco already! I walked in the city and found a French thing every French people is curious of- the blue house. The house is in a famous French song from Maxime Le Forestier  it is called La Maison Bleue. I loved the viewpoint of the city of San Francisco on Twin Peaks but I locked my car keys in the rental car at sunset! I asked people if they had AAA Assistance to get me back in my car  and nice people had it. They let me rest in their car until the assistance man came because it was cold! Lombard street was crazy but amazing  the cable car with the red road was fabulous  better than in my childhood dreams. Muir Beach was crazy beautiful! I loved San Francisco!

Using the Buddy System as an Au Pair,This blog is brought to you by au pair Simone from South Africa! Simone shared some advice for using the buddy system to make friends during your au pair year. InterExchange Au Pair USA knows that the success of a cultural exchange experience lies not only in happiness at work but in happiness at play too. For this reason  many InterExchange Local Coordinators use the ‘buddy system’ in addition to the monthly cluster meetings. The buddy system is when a Local Coordinator of a cluster connects a new au pair to a current au pair living in the area  making them buddies. This is done in the hopes to facilitate friendships and welcome the new au pair to the USA. The au pair already on program will be in contact with the new au pair before their arrival to eliminate the apprehension that could arise from not knowing anyone. Adrijana from Croatia had a great experience with her buddy  sharing  My buddy was the first person to introduce me to so many new people and new experiences  so I am very grateful to them. The buddy system is a great way for au pairs to support one another. Once a new au pair has been in the US for some time  they’ll be ready to pay it forward and mentor an arriving au pair.

Au Pairs and Their Host Families,One of the best parts of being an au pair is the relationship that you’ll form with your host family. These relationships often last a lifetime and many of our au pairs end up seeing their host families again years after the program. We asked our au pairs to tell us about their host family. Here’s what they had to say! My host family was so  so good to me! They were very patient and if I did not understand something they explained to me again. They never disrespect me and they always were very friendly. They make me part of their family and I always be grateful with them for all they did for me. The whole family made me feel very welcome and all of their relatives gave me the feeling that I was really a part of the family. I enjoyed that it was always a give and take and that I was never treated as a “worker”. I felt like a big sister with a lot more responsibilities. I had a lot of freedom in how I deal with my kids which was great because I felt like my host mom really trusted me. She always supported my decisions and I always tried to do things in a way she would do them too. She always showed me that she appreciated what I did which is a very important thing. My family always helped me when I needed something  talked with me about everything  let me make decisions how to arrange kids duties  accept me as a part of the family. I have a very good relationship with my host family. They were open to discuss with me about the children. They help me a lot to travel and they gave advice to visit cities. They help me in general to make my life easier and pleasant in USA. I feel like I was part of the family and they share everything in their life with me. They are really nice people to live with and we have a good friendship today. My host family was really good! I never had problems with them  I love and I miss them a lot. The work was hard but with good communication and support all is possible. They were comprehensive  fun and friendly. They allowed me to take part of their family easily and keep my independence at the same time  which I was very happy about. They also always took care of me  making sure I didn’t work excessively and although they were strict  they were also fair. They adjusted their treatment towards me as they gained confidence in my abilities. My host kid was one of the most wonderful little girls I’ve had the pleasure to know. She rocks. It’s always difficult to move in with people you don’t know  so there are tense situations. But all in all I love and miss my host family and I can’t wait to see them again.

10 Interesting Observations About the U.S.,Living in a different country is a crazy experience where you’ll constantly be discovering new things! Au pair Maricel from Spain told us about 10 cultural differences she’s noticed between the USA and her home country. I have been in the United States for one month and one week. Oh my gosh! Time is flying. This month  I’ve learned some customs  traditions  and other interesting things about American culture. Although I found some of these customs strange at first  now I have gotten so used to them that I don’t even realize that I’m slowly becoming more American. Here are 10 interesting things that I’ve learned about the U.S. so far! Here in the U.S.  when you go to a store  a museum  or anywhere else  the person working at the counter will always say  “Hello  how are you?” However  they aren’t really waiting for you to respond  “Doing well ” or “I’m not very good.” At first  I’d always answer  “Fine thanks  and you?” and then the person ignored me. One day  I asked my host mom  and she said that it’s just a custom and you don’t have to respond. I think it’s a strange custom to ask someone how they are  but not wait for a response. The first day I was living with my family  I remember that I brought my slippers  and my host dad (who is from England) said  “Here in the U.S.  we don’t use slippers. Here we go barefoot. In England  I used my slippers  but now that I’m here  I’ve gotten used to going barefoot.” My host family doesn’t mind if I use slippers or not  but I’m starting to get used to going barefoot. At first  this surprised me. When I wasn’t quite used to this yet  it happened in parking lots a lot  and I thought people were beeping at me for some reason! But nope  they just beep when they’re closed. The bread is so strange! Sometimes my host mom and I buy bread at the bakery  sometimes at the supermarket  but there’s not really any good bread anywhere. Here  the bread doesn’t smell like bread. This was my first instance of culture shock! Here in the United States  you can turn right on a red light  as long as there is no sign prohibiting it. I don’t know if this is the case everywhere in the United States  but in New York state  that’s the way it is. Except at a fast food restaurant  where no one really waits on you. In my culture  a tip is not necessary for most situations. For example  this week on Monday  it was 11 degrees Celsius  and today it’s been between 22 and 25. I never know if I need to wear a warm sweater or if I can just wear a t-shirt. American supermarkets are huge. There are a few little ones around  but the majority are huge. You can find thousands of types of potatoes  thousands of types of apples  milk  cereals  and more. The parking lots are big  too. They are so so big that the first time I went to the supermarket  I didn’t know where I had parked my car! I knew that I had parked on a corner  but I wasn’t sure in which row. So  I looked a little silly looking all over for my car. Oh  yes! The pharmacies are huge  and you can find everything you could ever want: toilet paper  notebook  razors  and more. When I make food for the girls  they always say  “thanks for this food.” It’s a little strange for me because I expect to cook something for them without a thank you. But when my host mom cooks  I always tell her thanks. Now it’s become my thing  and “sorry” and “thanks” come out of my mouth naturally! If you go to a restaurant and order something  be careful  because the portions are very large and filling. I say this because I always order the small portion  but it still seems large. That’s all I can think of at the moment  but that’s definitely not all! I am surprised by something new here all the time. Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

South African Au Pair Jacky Shares Her Advice,Being an au pair is the experience of a lifetime and will definitely change you for the better. Au pair Jacky  from South Africa  reflected on her time traveling as an au pair and shared it with us: “Why do we travel  be adventurous  and want to meet new people? Simple! Adventures begin with a thought  then go to a decision and become an action. We travel not to escape life but for life not to escape us. Life itself must be embraced as a great adventure  and you need to keep your adventure alive. “A journey is best measured not in the miles you’ve traveled but in the friends you’ve made  people you’ve met  adventures lived  and memories captured. The fast goers will go fast by doing things alone but if you want to go far  go and do things together. Some people will travel to find themselves  others to open their hearts and be of service to other people. Or maybe just because they want to experience different people  places  cultures  religions  and living. One of the best ways to learn is to travel. “There will be endless lessons  some good  some bad  exciting and boring  negative and positive but in the end  we learn even through our mistakes and those of others. To travel and meet new people  being adventurous and living your dreams is not a matter of money but of courage. “As soon as you start with your action to travel  you will be speechless but at the end  you will be the greatest storyteller  and it does not end there. There will always be a reason why you meet people  tell your stories  and share your experience. You might be the one person that crosses their path to change their lives.” Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

4 Ways Au Pair USA Is Different Than Other Agencies,When coming to the USA as an au pair  you’ll be sponsored by one of the 16 designated au pair agencies. It’s important to choose an agency that makes you feel confident and safe while providing you with a wonderful au pair experience. We’ve worked hard at Au Pair USA to be the best fit for all au pairs. While the 16 designated au pair agencies do have some similarities because of the program’s requirements  there are four main things that truly set InterExchange apart. The majority of the au pair agencies in the U.S. are profit-making companies. Au Pair USA is one of the few au pair agencies that is a non-profit organization. With InterExchange  your airfare is covered from your home country to your host family’s home and then back at the end of program. Our passion is facilitating cultural exchange between host families and au pairs and being a non-profit makes it easy for us to focus on that. After orientation  you’ll begin your year with your host family. We cover the major cities in the USA and the surrounding suburban areas. We are also present in smaller towns too. This means we can offer a variety of experiences to au pairs  depending on what you’re looking for. As an au pair  you’ll meet with an InterExchange employee every month called a Local Coordinator. Your Local Coordinator lives nearby your community and organizes events where you can meet other au pairs. Your Local Coordinator is always available to help you with any questions you may have or advice you might need. Most of our Local Coordinators have worked for Au Pair USA for years – they love this company and they love our au pairs! Au Pair USA began in 1988  making us one of the oldest au pair agencies. Our parent company  InterExchange  has been facilitating cultural exchange for over 50 years! Wisdom comes through time and our experience shows- 91% of InterExchange alumni would recommend us to a friend! Despite our age  we are always looking to improve and provide the best experience for our au pairs. You can learn more about InterExchange’s impacthere.

Meet Male Au Pair Adriaan from South Africa,Au pair Adriaan  from South Africa  has a unique story to tell! Adriaan first came to the USA with InterExchange a few years ago to live and work with the Ingber family in New Jersey. After returning home to South Africa  Adriaan is back at the Ingber’s again for another au pair placement. Adriaan is an amazing ‘BroPair’ who finds a way to connect individually with his four host kids. Not to mention  he’s a trained chef! We asked Adriaan to tell us about his experience as an au pair. I was looking for adventure. I wanted to meet people from all over the world and to really experience the full extent of a different culture  which you don’t always get from shorter overseas trips. A male friend of mine was an au pair in New York and had told me about how great the program was. I have always loved working with children and I liked the convenience of having both accommodation and transport offered to me  so becoming an au pair seemed to tick all the boxes. My first placement was great! I have returned to my original host family which  in many ways  speaks for itself. My host family travels a lot  so I was lucky enough to visit some amazing places both locally and internationally. Building many lifelong friendships was definitely another highlight for me. I met so many amazing people  who I am still in contact with today and some have even visited me in my home country. In my first year  I learned how to adapt when being pushed out of my comfort zone. I gained greater independence and learned which of my friendships  both old and new  would be lifelong. People were often surprised that men were or could be au pairs. They were interested to know what my daily activities would be like and  after my first placement  were very interested to know what my experience was like. However  those closest to me knew how much I enjoyed working with children and were very supportive of my decision. There are many families who only have boys. As it is important for the au pair to become fully invested in each child’s unique needs and interests  having a male au pair can make it easier for the au pair and host children to find common ground. Male au pairs can take on the same responsibilities as female au pairs but may have more in common with boys  whether it be playing the same sports or enjoying the same video games. This is not to say that male au pairs can’t work with girls or female au pairs with boys. I look after three boys and one girl  Shayna  and because she is the only girl I am conscious of making her feel included and taking an interest in the things she enjoys. I am a trained chef and luckily Shayna shares my passion for cooking  so we spend a lot of time in the kitchen together. These days  gender stereotypes are slowly disappearing and you will find that opposite genders share many of the same interests and abilities. It’s a great way to travel and to meet people from all over the world. I am lucky enough to have a host family who travels with their au pair but I also get to explore new things during my time off. You gain a unique perspective of children and in so doing enhance your childcare experience for future roles working with children  or simply for when you have your own. It was pretty easy returning to the same family and everyone was happy to have me back. Socially  it’s been an adjustment because I had a big group of friends during my first placement and I have had to make new friends. However  with the right effort  I have made friends along the way. In addition  being older has changed the dynamic. My interests have changed so I look to experience different parts of the American culture and I have revisited some of the surrounding cities to explore things I didn’t the first time around. I am also more conscious of how I spend my time off because I want to make the most of my time here. Including your au pair in various family activities will make them feel like a part of your family and strengthens your relationship. Let your au pair know that it is an optional activity so they know they can take their downtime if they need it  but that you’d like them to join if they feel up to it. In the same way  find ways to share your culture with your au pair by participating in cultural activities which teach your au pair more about your family and country. Remember that your au pair is an adult. Although it is a lot of fun being an au pair  it can be difficult to live where you work. Make sure your children are aware of their schedule and respect their need to enjoy their own private time. Lastly  confront new issues immediately. This ensures that the au pair is aware of any issues and allows them the opportunity to rectify the problem before repeating it. Coming back has reminded me of how great this program can be. I am pleased with my decision to return and have loved having the opportunity to introduce my fiancé to my host family  revisit my favorite spots  make new friends  and go on new adventures. Adriaan and his fiancé  Simone  decided to come to the USA and au pair in the same town. You can read their storyhere. Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

This Amazing Au Pair Wrote A Children’s Book,Original post by:Thais Dybax Brazilian au pair Thais has an unusual hidden talent… she’s a self-published author of a children’s book! With an undergraduate degree in design  Thais  age 25  has always had a creative mind. While on program with her host family outside of Boston  Thais decided to challenge herself even further. Inspired by her host child  Rosie  she put together something truly incredible. Thais tells us about her journey from au pair to author below. My idea for this project was born during an afternoon reading with my host kid  Rosie. I have always liked to read  and so does my host family. They have a bunch of books from the library at home! On a cold winter day in Massachusetts  Rosie and I were reading some stories together  and the book idea just popped into my mind. I decided to use my free time during the cold days after work to plan  write  and illustrate a customized book. I had a lot of challenges along the way – I had no idea what the process was to publish a book  especially in a different country! I did research and discovered all the steps that I needed to become a self-publisher. Another big challenge was the language! I am still learning English  so I had to ask for help from someone with more knowledge in the English language than me to correct my text. After six months  I had the result. The book was ready! It’s a first learning book for kids from ages two to seven years old. The book is customizable with the kid’s name and gender  and it’s printed on demand  so every book is going to be different for every child. The story is about a kid who lost its name inside the zoo and needs the help of the animals to find it again. It is written in rhymes  and I tried to combine my love for animals and knowledge in history  telling curious facts about animals and teaching at the same time the letters that form the name of each child. I have received many requests from au pairs who are starting the program and want to give a different gift to their host families and also from the ones that are leaving. I am very happy with the feedback I have received and to the United States for making me grow so much!

How to Deal with Culture Shock,Being an au pair is an exciting time and comes with ups and downs just like any other experience. Sometimes there is hesitation to talk about culture shock and homesickness. Au pairs and host families need to learn about these emotions and work together for everyone to make the most of their program year. Orientation is an exciting  adrenaline-filled adventure for our au pairs! Many au pairs are setting foot in the U.S. for the first time. InterExchange au pairs arrive in New York City and stay in the middle of Manhattan. Orientation topics include first aid  life in the United States  living with a host family  and more. It’s a fun week  and au pairs’ enthusiasm is as bright as the lights in Times Square! Once orientation is over  the au pairs head to their host families’ homes. This first weekend is a great time for au pairs to get to know their new families  begin the cultural exchange that is so key in the au pair program  and learn about daily routines. The initial phase is truly exhilarating for au pairs and their host families  and this new life may appear absolutely flawless. A few weeks in  everyone has figured out the daily routine. Life has become “normal” once again  and au pairs have begun to notice the differences between cultures as they make friends and start taking classes. Some frustration and confusion can creep in as these cultural differences spring up and make daily life a little uncomfortable when compared to their home country. After a few weeks  don’t be surprised if homesickness and culture shock enter the scene. It takes many forms – tears  anger  anxiety  oversleeping  or just a general sense of “blah.” The symptoms of homesickness vary for everyone and can last a few days or longer than a few weeks. Almost every au pair experiences homesickness to some degree. It’s part of being an au pair  so don’t worry about it! If you’re experiencing culture shock  ask for help. Your Local Coordinator is a resource for you and would love to meet for coffee to talk. You can also ask your host family for assistance when times are difficult. Working together will lead to the cure. This graph about the adaptation process to a new culture is a good example of the au pair and host family relationship too. Your experiences as a newcomer to any area or phase of your life will go up and down  like riding a wave. Au pairs usually get through stages one and two in their first two months after arriving in the U.S. Month three often brings with it stage three  when you might encounter difficulties in the au pair and host family relationship. Always remember that you are not alone! We at InterExchange are here to help. Stage four and five are Adjustment and Appreciation  a welcome relief after that challenging stage three. By now  au pairs have developed a new hobby  traveled around this beautiful  diverse country  made friends and have even more to look forward to. Au pairs know where the cool local hangouts are and appreciate things about both U.S. culture and their home culture. Sometimes solving a problem by yourself is the best way to do it. Getting over homesickness is not one of those times. Au pairs should ask their host family or Local Coordinator for assistance and talk about their feelings. This will help ease the discomfort and frustration that stage 3 brings. Asking for help is one of the keys to a successful program year and we’re always here to provide guidance.

South African Au Pairs Go On Program Together,Simone  from South Africa  didn’t originally plan on joining the au pair program. After becoming a teacher  Simone figured her desire to travel would be fulfilled at some unknown time in the future. However  someone very special convinced her to change her mind – her fiance. Now  Simone and her fiance  Adriaan  are both au pairing in New Jersey. Read Simone’s unique au pair story below. For many years my plan was to spend some time abroad after studying. However  when offered a good job after graduating  it seemed silly to pass up the opportunity. Traveling could wait  and it did wait  three years. It was when I met Adriaan  my fiance  that the travel bug really started to prod again. Adriaan had spent two years as an au pair in New Jersey and to say he loved every second was an understatement. He could relate almost every topic of conversation to his experience and I wanted to have this same feeling. After deciding it was time to travel and exploring a few options  it finally hit me. What about America? I asked Adriaan if he’d ever thought about going back and becoming an au pair again  which he hadn’t. That same day he was in contact with his host mom  Lori. So  how did you find host families in the same town?asks every person we’ve met since being in America. With my teaching year ending in December  we needed to arrive around January and  as fate would have it  this was when Adriaan’s host mom Lori needed her next au pair. Lori and her sister  also a host mom  were happy to help and put me in touch with three prospective families in the area. After exchanging a few messages  I simply had a gut feeling about my host mom  Christina. At first  I felt a little nervous to tell her that I had a fiance who’d be living nearby. I told her during the interview process and she was actually very excited! My host family lives in a small town and she was glad I would have someone to help me with homesickness. She said as long as I was present in the moment  she was happy I had some form of stability. The next thing I knew we were matched and today  my host kids and host parents love Adriaan too! So  what’s it like doing this with your fiance? It’s been four months since we arrived bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and we haven’t looked back. Having someone from home helps to curb the initial homesickness that many au pairs may face and guarantees you a travel companion throughout your stay. At the same time  I always remind myself to make an effort with other people because it is easy to be comfortable with what you already have. I let my host family and new friends know that Adriaan and I can do things separately  we don’t always need to be together. I’ve made sure that I make time for other people and build friendships on my own. I’m thankful to have a wonderful and welcoming host family. Being an au pair doesn’t feel like work to me. It’s nice to feel that I work for someone who sees me as a person and part of the family instead of just an employee. Being an au pair has been great for my relationship with my fiance. We’ve learned so much about each other and it’s solidified our decision because we’ve handled new experiences and stresses together. With a bag full of memories to cherish forever  I would recommend this experience to anyone  alone  with a friend or even with a fiance. Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

10 Au Pairs Tell Us How The Program Helped Them Grow,Becoming an au pair is one of the best choices you can make for your life and career. We asked our au pairs to tell us how they grew personally or professionally while on the program. Here’s what 10 of our au pairs had to say! I’ve improved at how to deal with challenges. I opened my mind to different points of view and that made me grow a lot as a person. I met new people  a new culture  and a new way of doing things. I have always been a very introverted person and I learned a lot about opening up to other people and addressing my concerns as well as positive aspects more directly. Professionally I feel like I am able to really handle anything that concerns the everyday life of children even without having the parents guide me. I always enjoyed working with children but it became even more natural during this year. I am more relaxed. I have more patience. And I smile more. I took some courses that made me grow as a professional and also I met lots of people that taught me different things about cultures. I learned how to live alone  taking care of myself successfully. I learned about punctuality  how important it is for everyone  including me. I learned that communication is an important issue for relationships with my host family and friends. I learned about how brave I am.  I learned how to take care of me more  learned to be more responsible for my actions. I think it’s really good for everyone to do this kind of journey in their life to see different parts of the world. I’ve learned that it’s okay to make mistakes  but you should always try to improve and correct those mistakes! My mind is clear and straight about what I am capable of  how able I am to get oriented and solve unlikely situations. How easy it is for me to engage and connect with others and also adapt to new cultures. In my case  the au pair experience was a way to pause my life and redefine my path. I am finally brave enough to pursue what I always wanted as a professional but was too scared to do before. As an au pair  you’ll become more independent  patient  and flexible. Your English will improve and so will your ability to understand new cultures. Not to mention  you’ll have an amazing adventure! Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

Five Reasons to Au Pair with InterExchange,Being an au pair is the adventure of a lifetime  but it can be hard to decide if it’s the right thing for you. Here are five reasons you should take the leap and become an au pair with InterExchange. We know that if you’re thinking about becoming an au pair  you love spending time with children. Your main job as an au pair is to care for your host kids full-time for one year. During those 12 months  you’ll see your host kids grow and develop in so many ways. You’ll be very important to them and your host parents- many of our host children say their au pair is like an older brother or sister to them. Remember  when you do what you love  you never work a day in your life. Moving to a new country can be scary which is why we do everything we can to support you in your journey. With InterExchange  many of the details will be taken care of for you  like your round-trip flights and medical insurance. You’ll also have the support of an InterExchange employee  called a Local Coordinator  who lives in your community and spends time with you throughout your year. You don’t have to do this by yourself; we are with you every step of the way. Learn moreabout the support you receive from InterExchange. There is no better way to improve your English than to live in the USA and speak English every day. You’ll be amazed at how quickly you learn the language from your host family  fellow au pairs  and other Americans around you. You may even dream in English at night! Becoming an au pair has a positive impact on your resume and future career for so many reasons. As we mentioned above  your English will dramatically improve which is a very valuable skill to employers. You’ll also become more flexible  mature  and responsible. Being an au pair is a wonderful way to make your resume stand out from the crowd and will create opportunities for you that you never would’ve had before. Many of our au pairs travel throughout the USA during their au pair year. It is not uncommon for you to go on vacation with your host family or for you to organize a trip with other au pairs. You never know what adventures are waiting for you. Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

The Hubbard Family Visits Their Au Pair in Ecuador,Local Coordinator Nina  of upstate New York  is constantly impressed by her host families and au pairs. One of her host families  the Hubbards  recently traveled to Ecuador to visit both their outgoing and incoming au pairs. This story is more common than you think- many of our au pairs and host families make international trips to see one another! It warms our hearts to watch our host families and au pairs create such a strong bond. Stories like this are what the au pair program is all about. Local Coordinator Nina tells us more below. 2 951 miles separate Ballston Lake  NY and Ibarra  Ecuador and yet three families became fast and joyful friends because of the au pair program with InterExchange. Last August  the Hubbard family had to let au pair Ana go home after two years with them. It was the perfect conclusion to a successful au pair experience  but the Hubbards wanted to go one step further. Ana lived with the Hubbards taking care of their three boys for two years  and it was an extremely successful au pair year- the Hubbards loved Ana and Ana loved all the Hubbards. The Hubbards are a welcoming family and they hosted Ana’s mom twice while Ana was their au pair. Both times that Ana’s mother visited  she invited them to Ecuador. One Sunday evening  the family was discussing their monthly goals of education and fun. The parents asked the boys if they would like to visit Ana’s world  learn about her culture  hear Spanish spoken all day  and see the country she loves so much. No further discussion was needed! At the ages of eight  six  and three the Hubbard boys went to Ecuador  a possibility never imagined two years earlier. The Hubbards were in Ecuador for ten days visiting Ana’s family and friends. They also visited their next au pair  Carolina  and her family. They enjoyed learning another way of life  eating traditional dishes made with rice  beans  and corn daily  and the warmth of the Ecuadorian people. Host mom Sarah said the best part of the trip was that it was an authentic experience. They were not tourists. The adventure culminated in a family BBQ for 28 people- the five Hubbards  Ana’s family  and Carolina’s family  with everyone speaking a smattering of English and Spanish. That is the best ending for a great au pair experience. Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

Polish Au Pair Follows Her Passions in America,Polish au pair Aleksandra  20 years old  is the ideal example of making the most of her time in the USA. Aleksandra arrived in Washington DC as an au pair 1.5 years ago and since then she’s taught her host kids Polish  traveled all over the country  joined multiple Polish cultural clubs  and has studied at the prestigious Georgetown University. Aleksandra kindly shared her incredible story with us. Life is a web filled with decisions and choices. We make them every single day. My name is Aleksandra Parszewska and more than two years ago I made one of the best decisions in my life. I decided to start a cultural exchange program by becoming an au pair and coming to the U.S. When I saw an InterExchange poster in my high school I got this feeling that it might be something especially for me. I was really interested in the whole idea  however  I could never have expected how much my life will be changed. It has been almost one and a half years since I came to the Canavan family and started this new chapter in my life. This chapter which has brought so many miracles and love. The Canavan family was my perfect match since our first conversation. I can’t describe how grateful I am for them  because of all their work  care  and love which they have been giving to me. My program hasn’t separated me from my passions and dreams. On the contrary  it has helped me to improve them  explore them on a different level. Moreover  it gave me a brilliant opportunity to study at one of the best universities in the U.S.  Georgetown in Washington DC. Daily life in the U.S. and taking courses has really helped me to move to a high level of English. This opened new doors for my future and next steps. Besides taking care of my two amazing host kids  sharing love with them  teaching them Polish  and exploring new things  I have thousands of other responsibilities and things to do. I am continuing to develop my skills and passions here on the other side of the ocean. Since November 2016 I have been playing in a nonprofit organization called the Polish Drama Club. I had a pleasure to perform in so many different shows  in different cities and different organizations like the Polish Embassy or the Polish National Alliance. Our drama club is an active group  so we are always preparing something. It helps me to grow and improve my skills not only with acting but also singing. I have also developed my second passion as a singer at the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. Besides those groups  I have recently joined a Polish Dance Group called Ojczyzna which spreads the Polish culture by presenting national dances. It’s so much fun to learn those difficult dances which I didn’t have the occasion to learn back in Poland. I have so many amazing opportunities to improve myself. Moreover to explore and support spreading the Polish culture here on another continent. A number of responsibilities haven’t stopped me with my traveling dreams either. As a little girl and teenager  I was dreaming about places which I want to see and explore  about people and cultures which I want to meet. I have been collecting priceless memories with my beloved host family  and friends from different parts of the U.S. Dancing with cowboys  exploring deserts and wonders of nature in Arizona  seeing the rodeo in Texas  admiring Niagara Falls in Canada  swimming in the ocean in Florida  visiting cities like Boston  New York  Baltimore  Philadelphia  Nashville  Miami  Phoenix  Denver  Las Vegas  and Chicago are only a part of my adventures. As I said at the beginning of my blog  life is full of decisions. So many of them can change our lives forever. It’s important to take the first step. Every single program has ups and downs  difficult  painful moment but also those ones full of happiness and love. In my program I have experienced them all  however  I have no regret. After all this time I can truly call this place my second home and my second family. Because the journey is the destination. Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange.

The Turners and Evelyn Epitomize Cultural Exchange,The Turners  of Scarsdale  NY  adore the unique cultural experience that Brazilian au pair Evelyn has introduced into their home. From teaching Spanish to South American geography lessons  the impact Evelyn has had on her host kids is undeniable. In fact  au pair Evelyn was sharing her Brazilian culture with her host family before she even arrived in the U.S.! Host mom Irena tells us their story. Evelyn’s unique background brings so much to our everyday life from keen organization to compassionate understanding and thoughtfulness. She comes from Brazil and first made her impression on us when she created an art map with pictures of our countries that showed connections between the two. She shared this with us over Skype and we fell in love with her personality. This was also the introduction of the Brazilian culture to our home. Evelyn teaches the children about her country and her language. She even helps with some Spanish which the children are taking in school. The children learned the location of Brazil in relation to the U.S. and learned that it has the biggest rainforest in the world. This learning has taught the children about geography and the world and introduced them to Portuguese and Spanish. The children have learned that a country’s customs can be different and we need to appreciate all of our differences. Evelyn gets to practice her English and learn about American culture which has its own nuances  and she gets to take the time to get to know how we live and learn about the U.S. My 7-year-old son enjoys playing soccer with Evelyn and she is familiar with the soccer stars of Brazil which he likes. My 7-year-old daughter enjoys doing art projects with her. We are truly so lucky to have this cultural exchange experience and share this year with Evelyn who puts her whole heart into her role with our family. She is responsible and reliable and brings lots of joy to the house. We know that she will go home with stronger American English and we hope we keep this bridge between her and our family and countries. The cultural exchange benefits go both ways  with au pair Evelyn stating  The au pair experience has already been the adventure of my life. I love my host family and the area I live. The people here are amazing. Before coming to New York as an au pair I had never left Brazil! I’m grateful for the experience I’ve had as an au pair! Evelyn made a video of their experience so far. Check it out below! Joy is a huge advocate for cultural exchange. She's lived across the U.S. and various countries around the world including the UK  Australia and Indonesia.

What I Love About My Host Mom,Our au pairs love their host moms for so many reasons! By just being there every day  these host moms have provided their au pairs with friendship  help  advice  inspiration  and love. They’ve helped to turn new cities into homes  and have formed lifelong bonds of family and friendship with their au pairs. This Mother’s Day  we’d like to extend a special thanks to all of the mothers who have been there for us and helped us grow throughout the years! “I can’t imagine my life without her ” said Lena. “We are like best friends. I can come to her with questions  problems  and concerns.” Lena’s host mom Erika’s strength as a mother and a person has been inspiration for Lena. Whenever any issues arrive  the two work together to solve them. “I know she understands me”  said Lena. “She is the best host mom in the universe!” Aaron says that his host mom made him feel welcome as soon as he arrived  making the transition from the U.S. to Mexico feel smooth. On Aaron’s birthday  he walked down the steps to start the work day  and his whole host family greeted him with a birthday surprise! “They all came into the kitchen singing the birthday song with balloons and gifts. This made me less sad about being away from my family in Mexico ” said Aaron. “Something that makes me feel like a member of the family is that she invites me to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas with them at Grandma’s house ” said Aaron. “I even have a stocking with my name on it!” “If I have a problem  I know I can reach her out talk to her about it ” said Aaron. “She will listen to me  be interested  and also give advice. She’s my best friend and I know I count on her for everything.” “I am doubly blessed because I have two people that I could call ‘mom’  my Mexican mom and my American mom: my host mom.” Jenny said she’ll be “forever grateful” for having her host mom in her life! She appreciates her host mom for pushing her to try new things  and for giving her patience and love. “I hope you can read these words  for all you do  for who you are ” she said. “You helped to show me a whole new culture that I had never experienced before. You shared with me your life story and opened up your home to me. Now it’s my own. You accepted me as a part of your family.” “My host mom always makes time for me  no matter how busy she is! She has the warmest smile  biggest heart  and a role model for me!” said Jolene. Some days  Jolene and her host mom talk about their days  share meals  and enjoy funny videos. But Jolene’s host mom also helped her find a horse shelter where she could volunteer  organize daily adventures  and plan and achieve her life goals. “I always feel a part of the Wiley family as if they are my own family!” Jolene said. “My host mom has been absolutely amazing from the get-go!” said Nataline. “My host mom of five kids works harder than anyone I know.” Nataline and her host mom have become close over the past seven months  and she’s so grateful to be with such a fantastic host family. “I struggled to get out of my shell in the beginning; my host mom pushed me (just like my mom would back home) to always go out and be confident in what I needed to do ” said Nataline. Her host mom always makes Nataline – and “everyone she comes in contact with” – feel special. She always includes Nataline in trips and family days. “My host mom is such a genuine  kind-hearted human being and deserves nothing but the best ” said Nataline. “Thank you for everything that you do to make my stay memorable. It never feels like a job. It really is such a pleasure being with you and your girls. Thank you for loving me the way you do! Thank you for caring so much and making me feel special.” Alisson’s host mom is  among other things  a neuroscientist  a fashionista  a fantastic mom  and a great friend. “She is always kind and nice to me and what I really like the most about her is her great taste in music and fashion said Alisson. “She grew up in Santa Cruz  California  which is an amazing and groovy place  which makes me understand why she is so amazing.” “I think that she is the most amazing host mom because she makes me stronger  independent  responsible  and thoughtful ” explained Alisson. She has also inspired Alisson to read more and learn more about American culture – specifically photography  classic movies  and fashion. She’s not just a host mom  but she’s a trustworthy and supportive friend who is there for her when she’s needed. “I think she is a great woman and I admire her so much ” said Alisson. “I feel so thankful and blessed to be part of her family and the most important to have such a wonderful host mom.” When Gabriela thinks of her host mom  the feeling that comes to mind is inspiration. “She’s always inspiring me to be better in so many aspects ” she said. Her host mom’s support and kindness has helped Gabriela to integrate into her host community. “No matter what  she’s always nice  patient  calm  and positive!” said Gabriela. Getting to know her host mom has inspired her to learn more and to be more positive. “Maybe because she reminds me my own mom ” she added. We are grateful to these host moms for the positivity and light they’ve brought to our au pairs’ lives. Happy Mother’s Day!

Au Pair Educational Course Requirements Frequently Asked Questions,This post was originally published in April 2019 and revised in September 2024 by other contributors. As part of theU.S. Department of State’s Au Pair Program regulations  au pairs are required to complete at least six semester hours of credit at anaccreditedpost-secondary institution during their program year. This educational requirement provides a fantastic way for you to pursue your educational interests  meet new people  and experience an important aspect of American culture. Host families are required to give au pairs up to$500 towards these educational classes per program year. Here are some frequently asked questions about the au pair education requirement. This information is also in the Au Pair USAAu Pair Handbook. Your Local Coordinator will have advice about eligible classes in your area. Six credits over the course of the au pair program year are required. A typical college-level class earns 3 credits and lasts several months  so it is important to get started finding a class right away. If the class you want to take is at an accredited post-secondary institute but it doesn’t offer credit  you may be able to count the number of hours of class time toward your requirement.. Each 30-hour class is equal to 3 credits  so you’ll likely need to take two classes to complete your au pair educational requirement. As with any other classes  be sure to submit aClass Pre-Approval Formbefore enrolling. Classes must be on the campus of and/or be associated with an accredited post-secondary institution  which is generally a college or university. Keep in mind that library  community center  and church-based classes typically are not accepted unless they are affiliated with an accredited  post-secondary institution. Sometimes classes can be taken virtually as well. Always check that the course you plan to take is through an accredited  post-secondary institution. You should always submit aClass Pre-Approval Formto Au Pair USA before enrolling or paying for a class. Au Pair USA reviews the forms  and will let you know if the course will be approved and how many credits you will receive. Sooner is better! Au Pair USA recommends researching the types of classes you are interested in taking as soon as you’ve matched with a host family. This will give you enough time to discuss the schedule with your host family and get thePre-Approvalprocess started. Keep in mind that most academic terms have specific start dates (often in August and January)  so be sure you have enough time to enroll before the start date. Most classes that earn academic credit at an accredited post-secondary institution are accepted. Classes that earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs) rather than academic credits (typically part of a university Continuing Education Program or Adult Education Program)) should have an academic focus such as language  marketing  history  science  psychology  English as a Second language  and so on. Make sure you getPre-Approvalfor all classes. In general  these classes are not acceptable unless they have a strong academic component and earn credits (not CEUs) at an accredited university. In general  if these classes are held at an accredited academic university  they will be approved. The most important thing to do is submit aClass Pre-Approval Form. Your Local Coordinator can also help you find appropriate course options and answer your questions. Check yourAu Pair USA Passport profileas some pre-approved classes may be listed there as well. Your host family may also be able to help you with local options  especially if they have hosted au pairs before. Weekend au pair courses which earn three credits from an accredited university provide you with an opportunity to earn credit quickly. This is especially useful if you are not able to complete a longer course due to time constraints. However  there are many different class operators and you will still need to make sure that the class you want to take is acceptable to Au Pair USA and affiliated with an accredited university. These classes are generally more expensive than local options because the au pair must pay for travel  food  and lodging in addition to the class’s tuition cost. Remember that au pairs have a $500 educational allowance provided by their host family for their 12-month program to complete the 6 credit hours. Au Pair USA does not accept courses that earn 6 credits in one weekend unless they involve 60 hours of classroom time. Some courses advertise that they will fulfill 60 hours worth of educational hours. However  when looking at the class schedule  only 30 hours are with an instructor learning in an educational environment  and the other 30 hours are assignments before and after. In this case  Au Pair USA would only be able to count the 30 hours of class time. If you are going home after the12-monthprogram is over  your education must be completed before your program end date. If you plan to extend your program  you have to complete the educational requirement before you can submit the extension application  which is no later than45days before your scheduled program end date. Au Pair USA recommends planning early! We cannot submit your extension request to the U.S. Department of State without your completed education component. When the course is finished  au pairs must obtain a school document as proof that they completed the class. This might be a letter  certificate  or transcript from the school. Au pairs then upload those documents to the “End of Year” tab inPassport. You must complete and upload these documents in order to successfully conclude the program. Host parents support au pairs in three ways: Yes. If you decide to extend your au pair program  you must fulfill new education requirements  and host parents must help pay. Au Pair USA hopes these answers provide clear guidance about the educational requirement for au pairs! Remember  your Local Coordinator orAu Pair Handbookare wonderful sources of information if you have further questions about the au pair  educational requirement.

9 Important Summer Safety Tips for Au Pairs,With summer around the corner  it’s a good time for au pairs and host families to discuss keeping kids safe during the summer months. Here are a few tips from the Local Coordinators in Atlanta  Raleigh  Chapel Hill  Charlotte  Baltimore  and Northern VA. We encourage you to take the time to go over these suggestions as a family! Families may have a preference for what type of sunscreen the au pair should use  so be sure to talk about what type to use  what SPF (Sun Protection Factor) number it needs to be  and how to apply it properly. For the sun sensitive folks  we recommend SPF 50+ and search for a brand that providesUVA and UVB protection. Also be sure to remind au pairs to reapply it every few hours under the cover of shade for 15 minutes before further sun exposure. Especially after swimming and other outdoor activities to maintain protection. Along with sunscreen  bug spray can provide important protection during the summer. Bug spray will help you avoid mosquitos  ticks  and other bugs that bite or sting. Host families should always discuss proper use of bug spray with your au pair including what kind to use  how often to apply it  and how to safely apply it to children. Protecting children’s heads and eyes from the sun is important. Hats provide shade for the face and keep us cooler. Sunglasses reduce strain on the eyes and protect them from sun damage. Host families should discuss how well their children swim and be sure the au pair understands the type of swim support the children need (life jackets  floats  water wings  etc.) It is always a good idea for the au pair to be in the water with the kids  even if they are confident swimmers. For younger children this is a MUST! Only swim in approved locations where the host family has said it is ok. Getting dehydrated can cause you to feel weak  lightheaded  or even lead to heat stroke or heat exhaustion. Getting plenty of water to drink will keep kids feeling their best as they play during the summer. Learn aboutwarning signsfor heat stroke/exhaustion andwhat to doif it happens. Thunderstorms can pop up quickly with little warning! Many local news stations have their own weather apps for phones that use the phone’s location and weather data to send you warning messages if bad weather is imminent. If a thunderstorm is coming  seek shelter inside a sturdy building. Be sure to check out thesetipsfrom the Red Cross. Families should discuss with au pairs where to take the kids in case of severe storms or tornados. Interior rooms on the lowest level of the home without windows are usually the safest place to be. Different parts of the US have different types of snakes  so it’s important for host families to discuss the types of snakes in your area. Don’t forget to discuss which ones are poisonous and how to avoid them. Help the au pair know what to do in case they see a snake in the yard or at the park. No exceptions! Not even if the window is cracked. Even if you will only be one minute  never leave a child or pet alone in a car. Host families and au pairs can brainstorm a list of fun places to visit during the summer. Include pools  parks  museums  day trips  play dates  picnics  arts and crafts  games  and more. Post the list on a wall or door and cross off the places as you visit them Having a list helps the au pair with planning  and everyone will learn more about the area while preventing the “I’m bored” battles that can occur during the summer. Most of all this summer  have fun  stay safe  and explore our world!

The 3 Best Places to Visit In the U.S. (According to Three Au Pairs),We asked 3 au pairs to tell us about their favorite place in the U.S. Here’s what Cynthia  Aurelie  and Danielle had to say about the places they loved visiting the most! Cynthia  from Hungary  had an amazing trip with friends to the West Coast. Her favorite cities on this trip were Santa Monica and San Francisco. “I felt like I was in the movies!” said Cynthia. “Visiting these places was a dream come true!” Aurielle  from France  says that Chicago “is a beautiful city with great architecture.” It’s very different from New York  with is the city that she’s visited the most. “The food was awesome ” said Aurelie. “People were very friendly.” She traveled with her friends to Chicago  and had a wonderful time! Danielle  from South Africa  said  “There is a lot of history  but also a great sense of the modern world. It is fantastic being so enthralled by the two very opposite ages of America.” Danielle visited the nation’s capital with her friends  and got to see sites such as the Lincoln Memorial.

Communication: The Key to Au Pair Program Monthly Contacts,Communication is the key to any relationship. The more each party communicates the easier a relationship becomes. This does not waiver in the au pair/host family relationship or in their relationship with their Local Coordinator. Every month the United States Department of State requires all au pair agencies to have monthly contact with the au pairs they are sponsoring for visas and the families that host them. While this is a requirement from the U.S. Department of State  it is more of a pleasure for me. I love that as a Local Coordinator for InterExchange Au Pair USA I get to know all of my families and their au pairs. I get to hear all the good (and the not so great) that goes on in their lives. They tell me all about sharing holidays and family events and the experiences they learn from each other. Each month I contact each family and au pair  first through a newsletter giving them up-to-date information  then through phone calls  emails and meetings. I am here as a key part of the support system for all of my families and their au pairs during their time together. At InterExchange Au Pair USA  we want to make sure you are supported and helped and not left hanging  which is a huge benefit that you don’t find with all child care options. I feel  as the Local Coordinator  it is extremely important to learn about and connect with all the families and au pairs right away. I want to get to know them so they feel confident that they can call on me if trouble arises. I let them all know that I am available for any questions or concerns at any time  not just our regular monthly contact. The more I know about each family and au pair  the easier it is for me to see how their family works and how to best help them work through any situation. My families know that I am always available and I will always get back to them within 24 hours. They also know that anything they talk to me about is kept confidential and will not be shared. I will never go back to host parents and tell them something their au pair told me in private and vice versa. Yet I do tell everyone that while the concerns they are confiding in me may be small (or large)  they will grow if they don’t talk to each other about them. I always encourage everyone to go back and talk to each other. “Communicate  Communicate Communicate!” Our monthly contact should not be seen as a bother but as a building block for a great relationship.

Fourth of July,Updated: July 1st  2020 The Fourth of July is considered the nation’s birthday and every year it’s a big party  minus the gifts! July 4th  1776 is the day that the US Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence. You will see lots of American flags waving  more so as we get closer to July 4th. Did you know that the flag was not adopted until a year later  on June 14th  1777? “Resolved  That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes  alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars  white in a blue field  representing a new constellation.” At that time  the country was made up of only 13 states. It’s a national holiday  so you usually would expect to see big parties and celebrations everywhere. Like everything else in 2020  the 4th of July celebrations will be different than usual this year. Big block parties are on hold  but you can expect a good family barbeque at home. Unless you’re in a big city where you can see the fireworks display from home  sparklers and neighborhood displays are your best bet. Larger celebrations will be televised on PBS and other major networks and a live version of the musical Hamilton will be available to view on Disney+ beginning July 3rd. Enjoy a safe and fun holiday au pairs and host families! Mary Beth was the InterExchange Au Pair USA Local Coordinator for the Chapel Hill area from 2010 to 2021.

Why Do Au Pairs Join Our Program?,There are a lot of reasons that a year working abroad as an au pair helps a young woman or man personally and professionally. All of our au pairs love children  but each has a different reason for spending a year providing child care in the United States. The au pair program is primarily a cultural exchange program  so learning English and getting to know American culture is a huge motivator for our au pairs – in fact  almost all candidates cite it as an important factor in applying to the program. “It was always a great dream of mine to live and work in America and I am really excited that it will become reality soon. I think the au pair job is a great opportunity to learn everything about America and how an American lives like  because as an au pair you are a part of the family and you are integrated in every step of the family’s life. And not at least of course I want to improve my English skills.”Jil from Germany Many au pairs will have increased job opportunities because of this language skill and cultural experience. For example  someone who has lived with an American family for a year would be better suited for a job doing business with Americans than someone whose knowledge of American culture is purely theoretical. “I’d like to speak perfectly fluent English. I would like to be accepted into a university to study communication  marketing  and advertising  and also work in this area. The au pair experience would enrich my CV but also enrich my own personal experiences.”Violaine from France Many of our au pairs have a professional interest in child development – they may be looking to pursue careers in education or child care. You can learn about au pairs’ educational background and goals in their profiles in Passport  our online application and communication system! “I have not yet fully decided what I want to do  however I do know that children will have a role in whatever I do. Being an au pair will help me with my future goals as it will enable me to reach out of my comfort zones by stretching my knowledge on children.”Taryn from England Finally  many au pairs have a sense of adventure and are looking to have a new  life-enriching experience. The concept of a “gap year” is very popular in Europe  and the concept is picking up speed elsewhere! A year away from home is a great time to become more independent  develop other interests and generally become a more worldly  well-rounded person before delving into university or professional life.

Au Pair 101: When You Need a Doctor,With the cold weather and wanting to stay indoors  it is especially important for au pairs and families to strive to stay healthy! Bacteria and viruses are all around us like snowflakes. Here are some tips to keep your family from getting sick: If you do get sick and need to see a doctor  we recommend going to an urgent care facility for quicker service. Urgent care facilities are staffed by doctors  nurse practitioners  and physician’s assistants  and usually see patients on a walk-in or appointment basis. Most offices should be in-network with our au pair’s insurance. For emergency care  go to the nearest hospital’s emergency department. Please feel free to check out ourinsurance information. Be sure to reach out to staff if you have any questions! If you are able  make an appointment at the urgent care center to avoid waiting when you arrive. Be sure to take your insurance card and identification with you. Tell the nurse and doctors what your symptoms are and what the problem is. They will usually check your weight  temperature  and blood pressure  and do a basic exam to help them diagnose the problem. If you have trouble understanding their questions  ask the nurse or doctor to repeat the question slowly and to use different words. They want to help you  so don’t be afraid to ask for help! If the doctor determines a prescription is necessary for you to get well  he or she will either write a script for the medicine for you to take to the pharmacy you choose  or they will ask you which pharmacy you prefer and send it electronically to the pharmacy. You then go to the pharmacy and either give them the script to fill or you can just pick up the prescription when it’s ready if it was sent electronically. CVS  Walgreens  Target  Rite Aid  and Walmart are just a few of the pharmacy choices in the area. Please remember that I am here to help you in any way!

Dealing With Homesickness as an Au Pair,Homesickness – that uncomfortable  out-of-place  missing-your-old-life feeling that hits you while you’re adjusting to a new place  is a normal feeling that can affect au pairs and others living in a new culture. According to Dr. Josh Klapow  a clinical psychologist and an associate professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham  “You’re not literally just missing your house. You’re missing what’s normal  what is routine  the larger sense of social space  because those are the things that help us survive.” Here are a few tips recommended by experts such as Dr. Klapow to help you deal with the feelings that may be coming your way: Everyone who leaves one home and moves to another experiences a bit of homesickness. Some people experience it more strongly than others  and some people may keep their feelings to themselves  but everyone goes through this to at least some degree. If you’re feeling sad  or frustrated  or even just a bit “out of it ”there is nothing wrong with you! Don’t get angry with yourself or frustrated with your au pair experience. Having these thoughts and feelings are completely normal. Since a lot of what you’re missing is your routine and your comfort zone  work to establish a new routine and comfort zone! Find a great café or park in your area that you enjoy visiting. Start taking your courses  or sign up for workout classes at a gym. Hang some favorite posters in your room  or establish an after-work tea and reading time. Anything that you enjoy doing can become your new “routine.” Staying in touch with your friends and family from home is important. Tools like Facebook and Skype are great (and free) ways to keep up with what is going on at home. Consider that au pairs 20 years ago certainly did not have these luxuries! But  don’t forget why you came to the States in the first place. Your goals may have been exploring  traveling  making new friends  practicing your English  and learning as much as you can from your time in the U.S. If you find yourself declining invitations from friends here in order to talk to someone back home  or if you find yourself getting on Skype and being sad or crying along with a loved one  it might be a good idea to limit your communication back home. Be present where you are – you worked so hard to make it here  so make the most of it! Your cluster is filled with au pairs who can relate to you about this experience – reach out to them. Sometimes you just need to talk with others who can understand where you’re coming from. It can be therapeutic to “vent ” or to express your feelings in a safe place. Don’t forget to have fun  too. It’s good to discuss your feelings and get them out  but not to dwell on them too much! Once you leave your home  a part of you might always miss it. But  eventually the disorienting  uncomfortable feelings that you experience when you’re new to a place will give way to a sense of calm. Without even realizing it  you’ll ease into your new home  and find yourself comfortably moving around your city and understanding the locals. The more time you spend immersed in your new community  the faster you’ll acclimate and the sooner you’ll feel at home. We encourage you to make an effort to participate as fully as possible in your host community – this will enrich your experience tremendously!

How to Request a Completion Certificate,I’m excited to tell you that we have a new procedure for requesting a Completion Certificate. Au pairs who successfully completed their program are able to upload all of their documents online in one place. That means that you no longer need to mail  email or fax any items to the InterExchange office; everything is now paperless and available through your Passport profile. When au pairs arrive back to their home countries  they can go to the link below and upload any remaining college certificates/transcripts and clear photos of their boarding pass and Cluster Meeting Attendance Card. You can find this “Request a Completion Certificate” link in the Quick Links box on your Passport Dashboard page. It’s in the top right corner and looks like this: We hope that this simple  online method encourages you to request your Completion Certificates. Thanks and have an excellent week!

Au Pair 101: How to Apply for A Social Security Card in Raleigh,InterExchange Au Pair USA is a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting cross-cultural awareness through exchange programs. For more than 40 years  InterExchange has been connecting young people from all over the world with life-changing international cultural exchange opportunities. In turn  we provide a unique answer for families to host an au pair who provides affordable  flexible  live-in child care. One of the first steps an au pair must take after she/he arrives at her/his host family’s home is going to the Social Security Office to apply for a Social Security Card. A Social Security Card is the US Government’s identification number for people who are either US citizens or who are legally allowed to work in the US  which is why Au Pairs need to get the card. We advise you to wait until 10 days to 2 weeks after you arrive at your host family’s home to be sure your arrival has been processed in the US Government’s database. Some au pairs have successfully gotten their cards before this time  but we cannot guarantee it will work early. You must have the Social Security Card to get your driver’s license and open a bank account  so this step needs to happen first. Before you go to the Social Security Office  be sure you have all the original documents you will need for the visit. A complete list of the documents is provided here. On that page’s the left column  be sure you choose: “Adult”  “Original”  and “Noncitizen” to get the correct list of documents.These are the blue “buttons” indicated in the screenshot shown here. Once you have all the documents together  it is time to visit the Social Security Office.  A host parent will need to take you or contact your Local Coordinator for help getting to the office if a host parent is not available.  The Raleigh Social Security Administration Office is located at 4701 Old Wake Forest Road  Raleigh  NC 27609. Be sure to check that these times are still correct before going to the Office. When you arrive at the office  you first must check in on the computer to receive your number (See #6 above). This is the number they will call when it is your turn. Expect to wait about 45 minutes to one hour when they are busy. We recommend going first thing in the morning and being there when they open at 9am when possible. Unfortunately you are not able to make an appointment for this visit. After you have a seat and wait  they will call your number and you will proceed to the desk that you are told to visit to be helped. The staff member will ask to see all of your documents and will enter the information in the computer. Once they have verified everything and receive approval from the computer system  you will be done. Your Social Security Card will arrive in the mail to your Host Family’s home usually in 2 weeks after your office visit.  It is unusual to have problems  but if you have problems  please contact your Local Coordinator to help resolve the issues before you visit the office again. Be sure you have added your name to the family’s mail with the US Post Office so the Social Security Card will be delivered. Your Local Coordinator will have the information for you in your Welcome To Raleigh Packet you receive when you arrive. Once you receive your Social Security Card  you will need to sign it and then put it in a safe place with your other important papers. Do not lose this card and never share the number with anyone.  For tips about keeping your number safe and preventing identity theft  check out these suggestions from the Social Security Administration.

Ready, Set, Drive! Au Pair Tips for Driving in the U.S.,Most host families expect their au pair to drive as part of their childcare responsibilities. Even if your host family doesn’t require driving as part of the au pair job  you may want to drive during your program year to get to monthly cluster meetings  visit local attractions on the weekends  or take an epic road trip. Here are Au Pair USA’s tips when it comes to driving in the U.S.: Before arriving on your au pair program  you’ll want to obtain an International Driver’s License. You will do this in your home country. Your local agency can help if you have any questions on how to obtain your International Driver’s License. In addition  you may want to begin doing research when it comes to driving in your state and the expectations/rules your host family has with regards todriving as their au pair. Ask your host family any questions you may have about using their vehicle and safety rules about driving in the U.S. Many states will require you to obtain a state driver’s license in addition to your International Driver’s License. Even if the particular state you’re going to doesn’t require it  you may want to still go through the process. Your state driver’s license serves as a picture identification and can also be helpful when visiting or driving in other states. Having a state driver’s license can also provide a less expensive rate on your host family’s insurance policy. While details will vary state to state  here’s a general overview of what you can expect when obtaining your state driver’s license: Most DMVs offer the exam(s) in other languages. If you feel more confident and comfortable taking the test in a language other than English  you can inquire about this option. The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)—or your state’s equivalent agency—is where you’ll go to obtain your state driver’s license. You can learn more about the specific process and driving laws by visiting your specific state’s DMV website: Be sure to practice  practice  practice when preparing for your practical driving test.

Chinese Au Pair Layla Talks About Her Experience,Most au pairs decide to join the program for a number of reasons: they want to improve their English  they are excited to live in a new country and learn about a new culture  and they enjoy taking care of kids. When Layla graduated college in 2022 with a degree in advertising  she knew she wasn’t quite ready to settle down in her home country of China. Layla had previously been to the U.S. on a summer exchange program in 2018  but never had the opportunity to actually live with an American host family and be fully immersed in American culture. A year later  she was applying to become an au pair withAu Pair USA. Layla went through the vigorous au pair application process—including an in-person interview  English assessment  and completing the online application. She was thrilled to be accepted and began interviewing with families right away. She knew her host family was “the one” for a number of reasons. “They were very experienced hosting au pairs ” Layla explains  “specifically au pairs from China”. Layla would be their fifth Chinese au pair! Layla also got to speak with the host family’s current au pair at the time  which provided her peace of mind from another au pair about their experience. Layla was soon en route to join her new American family in Boston  Massachusetts. Cultural differences can certainly come up when you’re an au pair though  even if you’ve been to the U.S. before and watched all the American movies and series your heart desires. There’s nothing quite like living through it! One cultural difference Layla has experienced during her program year has been the food. American cuisine is understandably different from Chinese cuisine  but fortunately living near some major universities with a plethora of international students  there are many authentic Asian restaurants to choose from when Layla craves a taste of home. Layla also shared that her host family makes it a point to order Chinese food often so she can eat some of her favorite foods at home too. Another cultural difference Layla shared has been communication styles. According to Layla  in Chinese culture  people don’t usually say things in a very straightforward way. Speaking directly can be considered rude. Layla says  “Sometimes if I want to ask my host family for vacation days or a weekend off  I practice by myself before I ask my host mom about it”. Layla’s experienced host mom has also let her know if she isn’t sure how to say something directly to them  she can message it instead. It’s been a good bridge during the cultural learning curve of communication Layla has experienced. Over the past year  Layla has made tons of friends in the Boston community  from other au pairs  to international students  to local professionals. These relationships have helped her acclimate to her new environment and provided her with support on hard days. As an only child  it was hard to leave her parents for an extended length of time  but Layla makes it a point to video chat with them daily to update them on her American life and let them know she is safe. Layla was fortunate to visit her parents this past July and is currently helping her mom obtain a tourist visa to visit the U.S. before the end of the year as well! Since Layla’s arrival to her host family’s Boston home in 2023  she has had an incredible experience. In fact  Layla even decided to extend her program participation for an additional year with her current host family!  “If you want to improve your English  don’t worry  you will practice it a lot! But  it’s also important if your host family wants their kids to learn your language  that you teach them as well.” Layla is currently teaching her host kids Mandarin. Communication is very important. Communicate with your host parents  especially if the kids are not behaving. They will most likely have some advice for you. And finally  “If you feel homesick  call your parents or friends at home  but don’t forget to make new friends where you’re living.” We’re so excited for Layla and her host family to experience another amazing year together!

Au Pairs Participate in Exchange Day 2024,Exchange Dayis a worldwide celebration of the power of international exchange. International exchange participants (including au pairs)  community stakeholders  and organizations who administer exchange programs share cultural diversity and American customs  give back to their communities  and have some fun!Exchange Dayis also an opportunity to raise awareness of international exchange programs and spread the word about the power and breadth of cultural exchange. Au Pair USA Local Coordinators typically organize events all around the country on Exchange Daywithin their local communities.Au pairs are often not the only exchange participants in attendance though!InterExchangestaff  other cultural exchange participants  and local community members are invited to engage in Exchange Dayevents too! August 5  2024 proved to be another Exchange Day success with events happening across the U.S. With New York City being the location of  InterExchange’s headquarters  participants from all around the tristate area joined forces atGod’s Love We Deliver a leading provider of nutritious  individually-tailored meals to people who are too sick to shop or cook for themselves.  Au pairs from Mexico  South Africa  and Germany attended the event at God’s Love We Deliver and worked together with other InterExchange participants and staff as volunteers  preparing and packaging food to be delivered to local residents in need of assistance. Alexa Valeria from Mexico said her favorite part of Exchange Daywas “to be able to learn more about the work that is done there (God’s Love We Deliver) and meet new people”. Indeed  while Exchange Day is certainly about giving back to our communities  it’s also a wonderful opportunity for au pairs and other cultural exchange participants to get to know each other and learn about other parts of the world. Local Coordinator Rini Ader says she enjoyed  “chatting with the other participants and hearing about their experiences.”  OtherExchange Dayeventsacross the country included a shoe drive in Connecticut  a BBQ and line dancing extravaganza in Upstate New York  and cookout celebrations in both Alabama and Tennessee  just to name a few.

Au Pair and Host Family Teamwork for the Win,During her first year as an au pair  Galu was sure she would extend her au pair experience for another year. After spending 12 incredible months in California  she was excited to find a new location to call home in the U.S. Shebegan interviewingwith host families in various parts of the country. She was beyond thrilled when a New York family reached out to her one day. Their initial message let her know they shared a commonality: a love for Broadway. A host family from New York who also loved Broadway? This was off to a great start!  Galu and the Banner family had their first interview  and Galu loved their energy! Galu remembers host mom Jennifer was very honest from the beginning explaining that her kids needed an au pair with a lot of energy. Galu  being very energetic herself and feeling the Banner family’s questions were thoughtful and considerate  knew it would be a great match. They decided to make it official  and Galu arrived soon after to begin her au pair extension year with the Banners. As a former teacher in Argentina  Galu had lots of experience working with children. Having also been an au pair for a year prior  she was well equipped when she met Jordan (4) and Joshua (6). Galu’s past experience and energetic and patient personality—paired with the family’s openness and honesty—enabled her to thrive as an au pair with them. She was fortunate her host family also gave her a lot of tools to help her achieve success in her au pair role for two young kids. I teach musical theater  so I teach my kids to breathe. When my kids are crying a lot  they’re not breathing  so I remind them to breathe. I teach them how to smell the flower and blow the candle  a way to take deep breaths.  -Galu  25 Argentina   This past spring  Galu and her host kids would often find dandelions outside. These were a great way to teach them to take deep breaths  while also having some fun by making a wish when they blew. “It helps them to relax and calm down”  Galu says. Galu isn’t only an excellent au pair when it comes to helping her host kids cope with challenging situations. She is also introducing them to her Argentinian culture and cuisine. I am really proud of my home country  so I do share a lot of culture with my host family  especially food. I like to cook  so I asked them if I could cook one day each week. One day  I was making chicken  and Joshua told me I was making his favorite chicken. Sometimes they are picky  so I felt really good about it. -Au pair Galu  25  Galu’s host family shows theirappreciationright back to her. They recently made her birthday very special  letting her sleep in and then wake up to find balloons and a special card. That evening  the Banners took her to dinner at an Argentinian restaurant. Then  they concluded the night with Argentinian treats and an Argentinian cake to celebrate her big day.  There is nothing more important to a parent than knowing that their children are happy and safe. Galu goes out of her way to ensure the safety of our children and their happiness. I have seen my children genuinely laugh with her and have a great time. We are happy to spend this time together  learn about her culture  and share our cultures with her. -Host Mom Jennifer Banner What makes the Banner family and au pair Galu’s partnership a success? They put a lot of attention oncommunicationand being a team. They want to be in agreement  so there is no confusion for the kids. When Galu is using certain techniques with the children  she shares them later that day with her host parents so they are aware and also asks their opinion if they’re open to it. The Banners are usually very appreciative of Galu’s suggestions  especially with her background in teaching. For example  Galu was instrumental in potty training Jordan  working together as a team with her host family and their approach. Galu’s au pair program is coming to an end this fall. It’s bittersweet for the Banners and her alike. “She will be missed once this chapter is over  but we believe she will do great things in her future endeavors”  says host mom Jennifer. Galu’s advice to future au pairs for a successful au pair experience: “Talk a lot with your host parents. Don’t make space for gray areas. It may seem easier  but it’s better to just ask and make sure. Everyone knows  and you’re all on the same page.” Marisa is a lover of all things cultural exchange.

How to Help Host Kids Learn Your Language,This post was originally published in November 2020 and revised in July 2024 by other contributors Sharing your native language with your host kids can be one of the most rewarding aspects of being an au pair! Did you know that  aside from your bubbly personality and childcare experience  the prospect of their children learning another language might have been a primary reason that your host family selected you to be their au pair? According to an article published byMichigan State University  bilingual children tend to be more equipped than their peers at solving problems and performing other mentally demanding tasks. As an added bonus  teaching your host children a second language will also help you improve your own English. You’ll learn new vocabulary and grammar as you teach words and phrases in your own language to your host family. It’s a win-win for everyone! Here are some ideas to exchange languages and cultures with your host kids through everyday activities. Kids have songs for waking up  cleaning up  eating our food  and going to bed. What more natural way for kids to learn a new language than to learn the same types of songs from other countries? The alphabet and numbers songs from your country are great options to have everyone singing in no time! Labeling household items in your native language  as well as in English  will help both youandthe children retain common vocabulary words. Try toothbrushes  kitchen appliances  bedroom furniture  and electronics to start. In Seattle  au pair Marrit helps kids practice her language by covering the host family’s entire home in sticky notes with the Dutch  Frisian  and English words for household items. On any given day in the house  one might open drawers to find yellow pads labeled “lepel” covering the spoons  or open the fridge to find “koelkast” posted on the “duer.” Just make sure your host family is comfortable having the house covered in Post-its! Even if your host kids won’t know all of the words in a picture book  reading and talking about the premise of the story is a great way to learn about different cultures’ folktales and traditions  as well as new words. Beautifully illustrated books are much more fun to learn from than a textbook! Here’s a tip: start small  and read books related to your culture even if there is no foreign language component. Au pair Hanna  for example  shared the English version of the German classicGrimms’ Fairy Tales. Then  when the kids are ready  you can take it a step further. Au pair Carol introduced her kids to the bilingual bookAm I Small?to help them practice English and learn Portuguese at the same time! Are your host kids budding artists? Ordering coloring books with descriptive text in other languages is a great way for kids to learn new words while their brains are actively thinking about the colors and scenery they’re completing. With your help explaining the theme and words in the book  their understanding of what they are creating will be absorbed while also learning about a new culture. Art projects can also be a fun  educational follow-up to a silly movie. Au pair Poppy  for example  watchedThe Princess and the Frogand then made frogs and other critters out of construction paper  learning the animals’ names along the way! Finally  games are a great way to introduce words to kids. You can play “Guess Who” and teach them adjectives describing people  play“Uno”for numbers and colors  andmemory games  such as card matching  for general vocabulary. Remember  language skills are atwo-way street! (That’s an English metaphor for two people working equally as hard on a task 😉). You may be worried about your English skills  and your host family may be curious as to how they will effectively communicate with you. The important thing to remember is to be patient and creative. But don’t take our word for it! One of our stellar au pairs  Lucas  can offer somemore advice about language learning and creativity!

5 Reasons Why Au Pairing with Au Pair USA is Safe,This post was originally published in April 2018 and revised in June 2024 by other contributors. Coming to a new country and living with a host family can cause nervousness for even the most experienced au pairs. One thing you don’t need to worry about when au pairing with Au Pair USA? Your well-being. Here are five reasons why au pairing with Au Pair USA is a safe option for young adults. When you come to the U.S. as an au pair  you arrive on what’s called aJ-1 Visa. Only 16 au pair agencies in the U.S. are granted these visa sponsor designations by the government  and InterExchange is included in that group. InterExchange is the organization that operates Au Pair USA and is one of the most experienced au pair agencies with over55 yearsof history. The J-1 Visa is supported by government regulations that are designed to protect your well-being. Here at InterExchange  we make sure that all government requirements are always followed by every host family and au pair. Our host families are so excited to welcome you into their home. Every InterExchange family must complete a comprehensive application in order to be accepted into the program and is also vetted in-person by our local staff. By the time you arrive to your host family  we’ve made sure that their home is appropriate for housing you and that they understand what it means to work with an au pair. We hear time and time again how deep the bond is between a host family and their au pair- it’s a relationship that lasts a lifetime. In fact  many host families get to know their au pair’s natural family whether via social media or international vacations! Every au pair is assigned a Local Coordinator (LC) who lives within an hour of the host family. Your Local Coordinator comes to your host family’s home shortly after you arrive in the USA. Your LC will help you settle into your new home and will check on you regularly via email and phone. You’ll also see your Au Pair USA Local Coordinator each month atmeet-up eventswith other local au pairs  which is the perfect way to make new friends. Day or night  weekday or weekend  holiday or working day  you’ll always be able to reach an InterExchange staff member if needed. InterExchange has a 24/7 phone number for both host families and au pairs to access if an urgent situation ever arises. You are never alone—we are always here to help. We work hard to create a wonderful experience for you throughout your au pair year and because of that  you’ll grow in so many ways while in the USA. Your English will improve  you’ll gain confidence  learn how to cope with homesickness  and become a more mature person overall. Being an au pair pushes your comfort zone so you can develop both personally and professionally. Leave the details up to us and focus on being the best au pair you can be!

Au Pair Cluster Events Celebrate Community, Connection, and Cultural Exchange,Did you know that when you join the Au Pair program  you don’t just become part of an American family  you are also welcomed into a community of au pairs from all over the world? Each Local Coordinator is responsible for a ‘cluster’ or group of au pairs who live nearby. Besides being an excellent resource for questions about the Au Pair program  your Local Coordinator will also be introducing you to au pairs in your area and will plan fun monthly outings called cluster events. Cluster events vary from outdoor excursions to potluck picnics to low-key coffee dates. They’re monthly occurrences that allow au pairs to make friends  experience American (and global) cultures with their peers  and even give back to the community sometimes! With dozens of Local Coordinators across the U.S. and events happening throughout the year  we can’t possibly highlight all the incredible ways cluster events can enrich your au pair experience  but here are a few of our recent favorite ones to share:  When the weather didn’t cooperate for an outdoor picnic  a New York host family came to the rescue and offered their home for a global feast. Au pairs brought Mexican dishes  Greek salad  and a Tiramisu birthday cake to celebrate a fellow au pair. Au pair Tim even played the piano and put on an impromptu performance for the group. Local Coordinator Aimee Trissel said  “We sang  we danced  we ate. We laughed and we all learned something about each other. Best cluster event yet!”  When the sun is shining  it’s never a bad idea to get out in nature! These au pairs recently headed to localKilgore Fallsin Maryland to hike with Local Coordinator Lori Veenema. Between beautiful weather and breathtaking waterfalls  even a small cluster event can feel like a big deal.   Who doesn’t love dancing? Local Coordinator Jill DeMarco took her group line dancing in New York. Au pairs took a private class at a dance studio and learned an entire routine to country music. Jill says  “I figure it’s very ‘American ’ and many of them go to Texas or Nashville for trips  and this is a taste of it.” An evening of music  movement  and many smiles was had by all!  What’s more American than watching a baseball game? San Diego Local Coordinator Dina Nichols organized aPadres baseball gamecluster event at Petco Park. From hearing the U.S. National Anthem to experiencing their first seventh inning stretch  au pairs enjoyed the experience  whether they were baseball fans or not!  Sometimes a littlebubble teais all you need. While this drink originated in Taiwan  it’s become popular worldwide. Portland au pairs recently met up for a bubble tea cluster event with their Local Coordinator Marisa Ferro. Au pairs loved tasting the different flavors and getting to know about each other’s cultures from all over the world.  Perhaps one of our most creative events to date  Local Coordinator Shana Pennington organized a succulent workshop as her cluster meeting recently. Au pairs created beautiful plant creations using potting soil  pebbles  and succulent trimmings.Crumbl cookieswere also present  which were a nice reward for their gardening “work”!  Volunteering is something that au pairs often do while on program. Fromhanding out water at city marathonstopreparing food for the homeless  au pairs are always eager to lend a hand. Tracy Hanover recently organized a volunteer cluster event opportunity in Philadelphia for her au pairs. Through theCradles to Crayonsorganization  they sorted and packed up clothing and other essentials for kids in need. We could go on and on about these creative  unique  and incredible cluster events our amazing Local Coordinators organize month after month for our au pairs!

Five Reasons to Be an Au Pair in Georgia,When you decide to become an au pair in the U.S.  you may already have an idea of where you’d like to live. Maybe you’re fantasizing about the crowded streets and high energy of New York or dreaming of the sunny weather and beautiful beaches in California. In this post  we are giving you five reasons to be an au pair in Georgia. Discover the rich history  exciting sports  natural beauty  and famous Southern hospitality of Georgia during your au pair year. From exploring historical sites and attending thrilling sporting events to enjoying year-round outdoor activities and experiencing the state’s unique culture  Georgia offers an unforgettable adventure. While Au Pair USA always recommends choosing your match based on the host family  not the location  don’t rule out this gem of a state. Even though Native American tribes  including the Apalachee  Cherokee  and Choctaw  have lived in the area that is now Georgia for thousands of years  it wasn’t actually called Georgia until 1733  when it was established as the 13th colony. In 1788  Georgia officially became the fourth U.S. state. During a year of cultural exchange  there are lots of historical sites to visit and museums to learn more about Georgia’s history. Georgia is home to several nationally recognized sports teams  including theAtlanta Bravesbaseball team Atlanta Falconsfootball team Atlanta Hawksbasketball team  andAtlanta Unitedsoccer team. Many au pairs enjoy attending sporting events during their program year to cheer the local team on. You’ll have lots of options if you find yourself living in Georgia! Georgia has no shortage of outdoor beauty. From hiking trails to beaches to waterfalls  Georgia has a lot to offer the au pair who enjoys outdoor adventures. If you like the water  you can usually find a lake  stream  or river if you’re not close to the Atlantic Ocean on Georgia’s east coast. Georgia may suit you well if you’re an au pair coming from a warm climate or hoping to enjoy one during your year abroad. The climate of Georgia is a humid  subtropical one. Most of the state has short  mild winters and long  hot summers. The good news is that you can go swimming or hang out outdoors most of the year with this type of weather. Although it does rain in Georgia  it only snows in certain parts of the state  which means you’re also not far from snow if you’re into skiing or snowboarding. Being an au pair in Georgia means you’ll get to experience the U.S. culture’s southern charm. Southern charm (also known as Southern hospitality) refers to a cultural stereotype of people who live in Southern U.S. states  like Georgia  showing kindness  warmth  and a welcoming attitude toward visitors. It is a unique aspect of the state and its people that will make you feel welcome right away. Whether you match with ahost family from Georgiaor just decide to visit during your au pair year  we hope you’ll find it as outstanding a place as we think it to be at Au Pair USA! If you’re ready to start your au pair adventure  carefully screened host families from Georgia and other states await your arrival at Au Pair USA! Not sure what to do next?

Meet Au Pair USA’s 2023 Super Au Pair Finalists!,Au Pair USA welcomes hundreds of au pairs from 25 different countries each year. With so many talented  caring  and diverse entries  it was hard to select a few to feature as our 2023 Super Au Pair finalists. Here are a few who stood out as exceptional au pairs.          When matching with their respective host families  many of these super au pairs agreed that they felt a special connection with them during the au pair interview process. Since the beginning they were so nice  and it just felt right  and then watching my host kid’s big smile throughout the screen made me say yes. -Mariana The au pair arrival is such a special moment for any au pair. For Isabella  she appreciated her host mom’s efforts in making her feel welcome and at home from the start. Her host mom took her to lunch  gave her a home tour  helped her set up her cell phone  and ensured she got settled in and was comfortable in her new home. For Vinicius  his host kids welcomed him by loaning him their special stuffed animals. The kids gave me drawings and lent me their teddy bears so I wouldn’t feel alone at bedtime. -Vinicius Once these au pairs got to work  they began bonding even more with their host families and exploring their new American communities. My host family is part of my family. I really love them and can’t imagine being here with another family. I know for sure if I just came to the U.S. for a visit  I wouldn’t have had this experience. Having a real family to be with and not just being by yourself is something that makes a great difference for me. -Isabela Not every day is rainbows and butterflies though  even for a super au pair. Some of their biggest challenges have been: Dealing with temper tantrums. They pass  though. The trick is just to sit them out. -Tim I believe that this program is an intense process of maturation and development of soft skills  as well as a journey of new friendships and discovering the world. -Vinicius When you participate in a year-long au pair program  you can expect to make great memories. For many of our super au pairs  those memories were so wonderful that they decided to extend their au pair experience (au pairs can decide to extend their programs an additional six  nine  or 12 months). When you participate in any cultural exchange program  especially the au pair program  core memories are made. One of the best memories is the Christmas morning  it was a day of pure happiness!! -Renata One time  my host kid was hugging his mom  then he said  “family hug” so my host dad joined in and then my host kid said “Mariana too!”. So we all hugged. I really felt like part of the family! -Mariana Being an au pair can be life-changing. If you’re thinking of becoming an au pair and wondering how to make your au pair experience a super one  here’s some advice straight from the source: Trust yourself  trust your gut. Try to enjoy as much as possible. You never know if you’re making the right or wrong decisions  but you’ve got to be able to deal with that. Be aware that you’ll miss your family and everything you have back home  but the memories you will make here will be worth it. It’s just one or two years. You can always go back home and pick up where you left off. -Isabela Really get to know your host kid and connect with them. Get to know other au pairs around to make friends from all over the world. Try new things  even if you’re afraid. Take chances and opportunities. Be flexible with your host family and always be open to help them and to spend time with them. -Mariana If you’re ready to get started on your au pair journey join us! Au Pair USA has been welcoming au pairs from all over the world since 1989. We can’t wait to help you find your American host family!  Marisa is a lover of all things cultural exchange.

Meet Isa, 2023 Super Au Pair Finalist!,Isa Mik  a 21-year-old au pair from the Netherlands  didn’t know where the au pair experience would bring her  but shedidknow she wasn’t willing to just wait around and see. Isa has always been adventurous and authentic as a person and when she arrived in the U.S. as an au pair  she didn’t let a new culture or country stop her. Being raised by parents who had traveled all over the world  they wanted their daughter to have similar experiences. Consequently  Isa spent a number of years of her childhood growing up in the Caribbean. It was there she developed a love for surfing and the beach. When Isa arrived in the U.S.  she settled in the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas. Isa could have sulked about the fact that the nearest ocean was hundreds of miles away  but instead she found a community of windsurfers at a local lake and started meeting up with the group regularly. It was there where Isa met her soon to be extension-year host family  the Manns. Although she had had a great year and relationship with her previous host family  Isa was eager for a new adventure in her second year as an au pair. I wanted a new and different experience. Change brings new opportunities and new challenges. If you have a new opportunity  why not do it?-Isa Isa told Roger Manns about the au pair program  and it turned out it was just what the host family didn’t know they needed to support their hectic work schedule and two growing children’s needs. A few months later  Isa was moving into the Manns’ home and quickly bonding with everyone. From the first day  Isa immersed herself into the family through sports  board games  and park play dates. Isa continues to make every day special and fun by creating scavenger hunts for her host children and even creating an escape room at their house for them and their friends to enjoy!   With so much in common with her host family  it made perfect sense for the Manns to surprise Isa with a birthday trip to Hawaii this past year. As they all share the same passion for the ocean  surfing  and hiking  it was truly a magical time spent together. I really felt at that moment like a part of the family.-Isa As Isa’s year comes to an end in the coming months  it’s not her big Hawaiian birthday trip she’ll miss most though. It’s the little  daily moments like dancing and laughing after dinner or creating pranks with her host kids to make her host parents laugh after a long day at work. Isa has made a tremendous effort to spend as much time as possible getting to know and having fun with her host family because she knows it has made her au pair experience the best it can be. I never go to my room after work. We’re always hanging out together  laughing and having fun.-Isa What’s next for Isa and the Manns after she returns home this June? The family is already planning to visit her in Europe  and Isa will follow in her parents’ footsteps and become a flight attendant  making it easy to continue seeing the world and visiting her American host family too. Congratulations  Isa  on being a 2023 Super Au Pair Finalist! Marisa is a lover of all things cultural exchange.

Meet Au Pair USA’s 2023 Super Au Pair: Fatima!,When Fatima first arrived in the U.S. in August 2022  she had no idea how much the Au Pair program would test her resilience and strength. After two matches with families that were not the right fit in her first year  she wasn’t sure remaining another year in the U.S. as an au pair was the best decision for her. She was nervous and scared to interview again. She contemplated returning home. But  Fatima reminded herself: I’m not a person who gives up easily. Then Fatima met Brian and Sarah Bellinkoff. They were a new family with one son  Levi. From the start  their conversations were full of laughter  and Fatima felt an immediate connection. After their second interview  Fatima found herself chatting with her soon-to-be host family more and more. Host mom Sarah extended a match offer  and Fatima happily accepted. In six weeks  they’d officially be living together. Fatima’s arrival was warm and welcoming. When she arrived in L.A.  where the Bellinkoffs live  Brian and Sarah showed her all around. Sarah took her to the library  the farmer’s market  and other local spots in the neighborhood. The Bellinkoffs have continued to include Fatima in their weekend plans  visiting The Bridge museum  the Santa Monica Aquarium  multiple beaches  and even Florida to visit Brian’s family. Fatima has loved meeting the Bellinkoff’s extended family and still talks to Grandma often.   Cultural exchange hasn’t stopped with Fatima learning about California and its surroundings. As a Jewish family  the Bellinkoffs have introduced Fatima to their culture through Shabbat dinner every Friday and including Fatima in their holiday plans  like celebrating Hanukkah together. Fatima has experienced many firsts with her American host family  like eating one of her now favorite foods: the pastrami sandwich. But she isn’t the only one being introduced to a new culture. The Bellinkoffs have also been exposed to Fatima’s Muslim and South African culture. Fatima often bakes South African dishes for her host family  like malva pudding. Her host mom loves it! Once or twice a week  she also cooks South African dinners  like chicken curry and dumplings. It’s been pretty amazing to be honest. Fatima’s host family has been so grateful not only for her delicious meals and warm heart  but also for the support they’ve received in helping to raise their son. It does take a village to raise a child. We don’t have a whole village  but we do have Fatima. And for us  that’s enough. As for Fatima  she’s in no rush to complete her second program year  with six months left to go. Fatima and her host family still have plans to go camping together this spring. After returning to South Africa this summer  Fatima wants to explore France  perhaps as an au pair in Paris. She is also currently working towards obtaining her TOEFL certificate (Teaching Others English as a Foreign Language)  and considering becoming an English teacher  maybe in South Korea or Vietnam. Despite some bumps along the road early in her au pair program year  Fatima says  (Being an au pair) is an amazing opportunity to see the world and get outside your comfort zone.﻿ Congratulations on being our 2023 Super Au Pair  Fatima!

Saying Goodbye to Your Host Family and the Au Pair Experience,It’s almost time for your au pair program to end  and you’re not sure how a year (or two) in the United States is already complete. Being an au pair has allowed you to learn about a new culture  a new place  a new family  and likely a new version of yourself.  Au Pair USAhas been supporting au pairs with their departures for over 30 years. Here are some of our best tips to help you transition back into life after your return to your home country. While it may feel like time is flying in your last months as an au pair  it’s important to use this period to ensure you’ll have asmooth departure. Request your flight home sooner rather than later fromAu Pair USA. Make plans to see friends you adore and visit places you love. Book your travel if you’re staying the additional 30 days andextend your insurance. Plan a special goodbye with your host family. The more planning  the more intentional you can be with how you spend the time you have left on the au pair program. Communicationis the key to any successful au pair and host family relationship  and it doesn’t stop when you’re getting ready to leave. Discuss with your host children what changes they can expect to face at home. Talk with your host family about how you’ll remain in contact. Be open to talking about your departure  especially with your host children  to ensure there are no surprises (and hopefully fewer tears) when departure day arrives. Just like you likely experiencedculture shockwhen you first arrived in the U.S.  you will probably experience some form ofreverse culture shockwhen you return to your home country. Remember you have been away from your home country for a year or longer. Your home may be different from how you left it  especially becauseyouare different from how you were when you left it. You will undoubtedly see things with a new perspective after living abroad for some time. After an exciting year living and traveling the U.S. as an au pair  life can feel like you’re standing still when you return home. One way to ensure you don’t feel stuck is to have the next step ready to go. Whether you’re applying to begin or return to university  starting a new job  changing homes  or traveling someplace new  having clarity in your next steps will keep you motivated and excited for your next chapter of life. Just because you’re no longer living together  doesn’t mean you can’t remain close. Decide how you will remain in contact with your host family. Will it be video chat? Texts? Phone calls? You may even want to commit to a schedule of chatting weekly or monthly. Consider buying or making your host family a goodbye gift so they think of you  their au pair  often. Some ideas could include a framed photo  a personalized holiday ornament  or a scrapbook of your memories together. Being an au pair is a life-changing experience you will remember forever. Remember to focus on gratitude for the time you had an au pair and not to dwell on the sadness you may feel about your au pair program ending.Au Pair USAknows how impactful the au pair program is for both au pairs and host families. We hope these tips will help your au pair departure be less challenging and more exciting as you begin your next season of life with this incredible cultural exchange experience that shaped you.

Au Pair Issues: What to Do if Your Host Child Rejects You,When you first start as an au pair  issues may arise that you aren’t ready for – such as what if your host child rejects you? Most au pairs have a vision of what their first encounter with their host family will be like. They dream of the host children hugging them tightly upon arrival  instantly bonding over some sweets from their home country  and immediately becoming a big sister or big brother type of figure in the host family’s home. While theseexperiencescertainly exist  your situation will likely be something different. Your host child may be shy  resistant to change  or present you with difficult behaviors at first. This is very normal and not something you  as an au pair  should internalize or feel guilty about – this common occurrence is not a reflection on you. Here are a few tips for au pairs dealing with difficult kids. Try to keep in mind that having a new person living in the host child’s home is a new and strange experience for them. When you’re an au pair  first-week anxieties in your host family’s kids are hardly unusual. Your host children may not be used to another grown-up sharing personal space with them  being around for dinner or bedtime  and taking up part of their parent’s attention. Adapting to a new situation can be hard  especially for a kid. Having empathy and remembering they are young and may not have the capacity to fully understand why these changes have taken place is important. Consider talking to your host family about it and asking your host child questions about how they feel about these changes. For example  “I know it’s different having me drive you to ballet instead of Mommy. How does that make you feel?” Also  remind your host children that you are their au pair  not their parents  and can never replace their mom or dad. A year can feel like a lifetime to a young child. If you’re replacing an au pair who has spent a year or longer with your host family  your host child will likely need some time to process the change. They may compare you  grieve their former au pair’s absence  and feel like they can’t have the same wonderful relationship with another au pair. Because you are unique  don’t try to copy everything their former au pair did  even if they remind you of it all the time. Your relationship with the host family will be different  and it can also be just as special. Make an effort to participate in lots of family activities and get to know your host kids’ personal interests. Ask them lots of questions and learn about the activities and games they enjoy. If possible  ask the former au pair for advice to help you become successful  especially if they themselves were not the family’s first au pair either. Try not to take anything personally. It can take time to form a strong bond with your host children  especially during the first few weeks. Some children may act out during this time. This is completely normal! Remember to talk with your host family about how to address discipline  especially during this challenging transition. If you feel like you don’t measure up right away  keep trying. The mostrewarding experiencescan also be the most challenging at first. Being respectful  empathetic  and kind are ways you can ensure you’re doing the best you can to build connections with your host kids. Marisa is a lover of all things cultural exchange.

How to Match with the Right Host Family,This post was originally published in June 2019 and revised in December 2023 by other contributors. Every au pair and host family match is unique  and we know that yours is going to be special. Are you unsure of how to choose the right host family for you? This feeling is normal and to be expected; it’s a very big decision! Here are some tips to help you as you decide which host family is right for your au pair experience: A family may surprise you  even if their initial profile doesn’t seem like a fit. Take every interview opportunity you can to connect with a new family and come into the conversation with an open mind andprepared questions. A quick tip – be sure to be on time to your calls since punctuality is an essential value in American culture. You may have an area of the U.S. that you have been dreaming of living in  but this isn’t a good way to choose your host family. It’s much more important for you and your host family to get along  have the same goals  and be a strong team. Remember  you can always use your vacation time and travel month to see your favorite American cities. Take time to think about your personality and the age range of the kids that you want to care for. Babies and toddlers require a personality that is okay with staying home and sticking to a routine. Older children need a strong driver for their various activities. If you like to be very active  a baby may not be the best option. If you are a more calm  introverted au pair  older children who require high energy may not be a good fit. Even though it’s to be expected you’ll be at home more with a baby and possibly driving more with older children  it’s always best to ask specific questions with regards to routine and expectations. You may be surprised by what you learn! You and your host family don’t need to be exactly the same  but your personalities do need to work together to create a successful relationship. You can uncover this by asking as many questions as you can! Here are a few to get you started: If you don’t understand an answer  ask the host family to explain further. Pay attention to the host family’s lifestyle and values and consider if that’s the way of life that you want to take on for one year. An outside opinion can be helpful when discovering what it’s like to care for a host family’s children. Some families may ask their current au pair to help them in the interview process. If they don’t  consider asking the host family if you can speak with their former/current au pair  nanny  or caregiver. This is also a great way for you to get some advice on how to be the best au pair that you can be. It’s important to put your best foot forward  but it’s even more important to be authentically you. Matches that succeed are based on honesty and open communication. If you pretend to be something you’re not just to find a match  your au pair experience may not work out the way you envisioned it. Don’t be afraid to show who you truly are. Finding the right host family will ensure your au pair experience is one that will provide you with the experience of a lifetime. Matching with the right host family is important for your au pair year. These are not only the people you will live with and learn from for the next 12 months; they may become lifelong friends  even after you return home. By knowing who you are and what you’re looking for  while also keeping an open mind to family structures and locations you hadn’t considered  you can navigate the matching process with ease. If you’re ready to get started on your au pair journey Au Pair USAis here to support you. For over 30 years  we’ve been successfully placing au pairs with carefully screened host families all over the U.S.A. We look forward to helping you find the right host family for you!

Au Pairs and the TCS NYC Marathon: A Journey of Cultural Exchange and Inspiration,TheTCS New York City Marathon  a global spectacle of athleticism and endurance  serves as a powerful platform for cultural exchange and personal growth. Au pairs—young cultural ambassadors immersed in American life—have discovered the marathon to be more than just a sporting event; it is an opportunity to immerse themselves in American culture  forge connections with diverse communities  and make a meaningful contribution to their host community . For our au pairs  volunteering at the TCS NYC Marathon represents a unique opportunity to witness firsthand the American passion for sports and the values that underpin them. “I was surprised how many people were taking part at the marathon and how many different countries were represented from all over the world ” observed Anna  an Austrian Au Pair USA participant currently living in Connecticut. “I even saw an Austrian person (what I didn’t expect). Seeing so many cultures coming together to run 26 Miles was an awesome experience.” The group of enthusiastic au pairs embraced the opportunity to immerse themselves in the heart of the TCS NYC Marathon by volunteering at the 21 -mile marker  a notoriously challenging section of the race. These au pairs  stationed amidst the energy and determination of the runners  witnessed the unwavering spirit of marathoners from around the globe. “I was so proud of my au pairs that they were willing to take one of their days off on a weekend to do this with me ” says Local Coordinator  Nancy Greenspan Wilson. “It meant so much and I hope that they enjoyed the experience as much as I enjoyed doing it with them.” Local Coordinator Nancy Wilson shares her enthusiasm with Austrian au pair  Anna. The volunteering experience created a lasting  memory for the au pairs  not only deepening their understanding of the American culture of volunteerism and sports but also enriching their personal journeys. Another au pair  Alejandra  initially weary from her trip from Philadelphia  found renewed energy amidst the vibrant atmosphere of the marathon. She observed  “My whole mood changed. It was really pleasant to support the runners.” The au pairs’ involvement in the TCS NYC Marathon extends beyond mere spectatorship; it is an active engagement with the community and a demonstration of their willingness to contribute. Their presence at Mile 21   a critical stage of the race  provided much-needed encouragement and support to the runners  reminding them that they were not alone in their pursuit of the finish line. The au pairs’ participation in the TCS NYC Marathon serves as a testament to the transformative power ofsports diplomacy. Their willingness to step outside their comfort zones  engage with diverse communities  and contribute to a meaningful event highlights the essence of cross-cultural understanding. Call to Action: Embrace the TCS NYC Marathon Experience Au pairs are encouraged to embrace the TCS NYC Marathon experience and similar events  whether as spectators  volunteers  or even participants. By immersing themselves in this global sporting event  they can foster deeper cultural understanding  build lasting friendships  and create unforgettable memories. The marathon offers a unique opportunity to connect with the heart of American culture and contribute to a shared passion for athleticism and perseverance.

Lessons on the Au Pair Educational Requirement From Our Au Pairs,This post was originally published in November 2020 and revised in November 2023 by other contributors. POP QUIZ: which of the statements below isnottrue? That’s a trick question: all are true! Don’t worry: university-level courses may not surprise you with as many “pop” (unannounced) quizzes as did your early education. Similarly  you shouldn’t be surprised to learn that  as an au pair  you can take university courses that will stimulate your mind and enrich your life and career when you return home. You may be eager to enroll in English as a Second Language (ESL) classes to improve your English communication and comprehension skills. Or maybe you’d like to take advantage of the opportunities to promote personal and professional development or introduce a new interest or subject into your life as an au pair. We asked four au pairs about their experiences taking classes in the USA. Finally  au pair Alison  from Mexico  took American Sign Language atBellevue College. I chose “Innovation Leadership” mainly because I’m in business and “Women Making History: Ten Objects  Many Stories” because the topic I’m more into is feminism. Although I started the program with an advanced English level  I found it very convenient to add the course “English for Career Development” to my resumé. I didn’t want to take a regular English class  so I selected this one  focusing on the current professional path I’m building right now. In January of this year I had the chance to travel to Uganda as a teacher. During my internship I noticed a lot of children didn’t go to school because they were working  taking care of (their own) babies or getting married. I knew this was not right but had no judicial knowledge to prevent it. I graduated in my own country but when I came here and knew I would have the chance to take “Child Protection: Children’s Rights in Theory and Practice ” I was really looking forward to it. This really is a wonderful opportunity to broaden my knowledge in a field I am really interested in. I think it is important to have the ability to talk with everyone. I consider this like another normal language that allows me to talk with any non-verbal person and make them feel understood. Taking ‘Women Making History’ taught me about empowering women generally and also helped me grow as a woman. Combining work and study is a real challenge. Before coming here  I did not like to study. It felt like something I had to do  an obligation. Right now  I don’t have that feeling at all. I take this class for myself  and I enjoy it. Getting the chance to study at a prestigious university in the country makes me proud. I always knew before coming to the USA that I didn’t want to take general classes but courses related to the field to which I wanted to dedicate myself. Also  one of my goals while doing this program is to improve my resumé so by the time it comes  I will be able to focus my future jobs in everything I’ve learned here. English is a professional tool that can open up hundreds of doors in the professional field. It has helped me realize how important it is to know and can talk with deaf people  that they deserve to be understood like everyone else. I know it will help me in the future in any job  knowing this will give me an advantage on my CV.  The factor that was hardest for me was the language. But I came to improve my English  and taking classes helped achieve that goal.  Taking the class in English is a big difference but I love it. I learn a lot of new academic vocabulary. It’s cool to be able to talk with people that share your interests. This course is really practical and gives me a lot of concrete examples which makes it easier to understand. Another added value is the interviews during the course.  I’d say the experience is not very different from instruction in Colombia. Even though it has similarities  just having the experience feels very fulfilling.  There are many different people taking this class: different ages  nationalities  for different reasons  who make this more interesting. Yes! They are very interested in what I study and we have talked about these courses and how they help me to build a great CV for later when I look for work in the business industry. They totally support me in my educational career. I told them about the course and they were really interested in it! I did and we all agreed that it was a great idea to certify my English as that could open up a lot of opportunities outside of the Au Pair program. Yes! They love that I am taking this class. I’m currently working with a baby who is non-verbal  so this is helping me to teach her and put in practice my class. I would recommend that an au pair be open! The courses you would love to have are not always available in your town or they are out of budget. Be adaptable to change and open to study whatever it comes for you! Look for a class that you’re really interested in. This is purely for yourself so choose something that you are really looking forward to enroll in. If possible it would be nice to take an in person class so you can meet new people. But on the other hand  when you choose an online class  you can do it at your own pace. Try taking classes that you know you might not take in your home country like a language in general  since you can take that class no matter where in the globe you are. If you’ve always been interested in something that maybe in your home country is not “popular” but you really like it  try getting a class of it! You never know all the things you can discover of yourself and the world itself. Don’t miss this opportunity and take all the classes you can and want. Think about what could help you in your future depending on your goals and put into practice as much as you can. The classes that Luisa  Laura  Alison  and Lauri took are just a few that might be available to you as an au pair! There are hundreds of classes you can take that will enrich your professional life. Many people find that traveling abroad helps them better understand what they want from theirprofessional life. Like these studious au pairs  you too can spend a year abroad and reorient yourself for professional success! Ready to find out more?Sign uptoday!

What Happens if You Rematch as an Au Pair?,While most au pairs don’t wish for a rematch  there are some situations where it may be the best option for both au pair and host family. A rematch is when either a host family or au pair (or both) feel it’s best to separate and end the match. Au pair rematches can occur for a number of reasons  but here are the most common causesAu Pair USAhas seen in serving thousands of au pairs and host families over the past 30+ years. Once your Local Coordinator is aware of a problem  they will do everything they can to help resolve the issues before going straight to rematch. This may include conducting a match improvement meeting. The purpose of this meeting is to ensure both you and your host family have the ability to openly express yourselves in a safe space with an objective person (your Local Coordinator) leading the discussion. Many matches are able to be repaired by simply having this meeting and coming up with an action plan to resolve the issue that everyone is committed to working on. If the match is not able to be repaired  a rematch then occurs. Your Local Coordinator will schedule a transition meeting. During this meeting  you  your host family  and Local Coordinator are present and review a checklist of items to ensure everyone is on the same page moving forward. Your Local Coordinator will set expectations regarding the transition period (typically a two-week period)  note your final au pair work day and release date for you to move onto your next match or return to your home country  and a final housing date (the last day your host family will host you in their home). In most cases  you will remain in the host family’s home during the transition period. During this time  your au pair profile will be available in Passport for families to see and request interviews with you. Please ensure you are available during non-working hours to meet with families during this transition period. If you’re unable to secure a new host family during this time  you will need to return home. Rematching may not be the ideal situation you considered when you decided to become an au pair  but it can be a wonderful opportunity to find the right host family if your current match is not working out.Au Pair USAwill do everything in our power to assist you as an au pair during this time and to help the transition be as seamless as possible should you experience a rematch with your host family. If you have questions about the rematch process and are a current au pair  please contact your Local Coordinator. If you’re interested in becoming an au pair  you can begin your au pair journey by completing aquick questionnaire. Marisa is a lover of all things cultural exchange.

Au Pair Halloween Activities,It’s almost Halloween! As an au pair  you may not have celebrated this spooky holiday before but you’ve probably seen at least one or two movies that feature this creepiest of nights. Well  you’re in for a treat (and maybe a trick too)! Besides the typical dressing up in costume  kids typically enjoy trick-or-treating—atradition that became very popular in 20th Century Americawhich involves going door to door to neighbors’ homes collecting candy on October 31st. There are lots of additional activities you can do with your host kids leading up to the big day. Check out a few we’ve highlighted from ourPinterest boardto help you get into the spooky spirit: There are many Halloween crafts to choose from  but we especially love thismummy paper plate lacing craft. It’s super simple and will help develop your child’s fine motor skills. For some more Halloween crafty fun  you can try making aspider web suncatcher.  The best part about making crafts is you can also use them to decorate your home for the Halloween holiday!  What’s more fun than digging around and finding creepy Halloween goodies? Creating a Halloween sensory bin is easy  fun  and will keep your children busy! Followthese instructionsor change it up with different items. The concept is the same. We especially love using the skeleton hands as tools to dig! If you’re caring for younger children  be sure to use age-appropriate items that don’t pose a choking risk.  Turn everyday foods into Halloween fun with simple twists. For example draw ghost faceson your string cheese packages or cookmummy dogs(make your hot dogs look like mummies using pieces of Crescent rolls). There’s even a yummycookie recipethat will turn basic cookies into colorful monsters. Sky’s the limit with how creative you can make your regular  everyday foods during the Halloween season. As always  be sure to keep in mind any food allergies that may be present in your host family (this goes for trick-or-treat goodies  too!).  Encourage creativity by asking your host child to come up with their own witch’s spell. Ask them how they make it  what it’s called  and what it does? There’s even afun printoutyou can get so they’ll remember it for years to come.  Learn all the Halloween vocabulary by doing a Halloween word search activity. You can either print one or create your own. We recommend thisgiant Halloween word searchso everyone in the family can easily participate.  Keep in mind that some families do not celebrate Halloween for religious reasons  so it’s always best to check what is appropriate in your host family’s home. Be sure to check out our fullPinterest boardto see even more Halloween activities you can try this year as an au pair. Taking advantage of cultural exchange activities  especially during the holidays  is an excellent way to make the most of your au pair experience.Au Pair USAwishes you a happy Halloween!

5 Ways to Create Work-Life Balance as an Au Pair,Being an au pair is no easy job. You need patience. You needresilience. You needstrength. It can be easy to fall into a habit of work  eat  sleep  and repeat. Here are some tips fromAu Pair USAfor au pairs to create a healthy work-life balance:  If you’re stressed about important tasks that need to get done  there’s no better way to clear the to-do list clutter than to just complete them! For example  if you’re worried about completing your au pair education hours  research the courses you’d like to take right away and register in advance. You will automatically feel more balanced and less stressed if you’ve been able to remove some things you need to get done from your mind.  Taking care of children for up to 10 hours a day can be exhausting! It’s important to ensure you’re taking time to rest physically and mentally. For example  you could go to sleep earlier than usual if you’re feeling extra tired after a long day or spend a few minutes meditating after work before it’s time to go to school to reset your mind. Balancing your work and life should always include a rest period.  Whether you decide to go to the gym and take an intense cardio class or take a walk around your neighborhood  exercise is an important way to maintain work-life balance. Decide what a consistent exercise routine looks like for you and commit to it. Exercise allows you to stimulate hormones that make you feel happier  allowing you to feel more balanced overall.  As an au pair  it’s no secret you’re excited to travel around the U.S. during your program year. The best way to make that happen is by planning in advance. Decide where you’d like to go and when. Talk with your au pair friends you plan to travel with. Ask your host family if those dates work with their schedule. Planning vacations far in advance will allow you plenty of time to budget  research  and look forward to visiting new and exciting places.  You will have hard days like anyone else. Having positive friends or family to talk to during those times is so important. Whether this is your host family  your natural family  your local coordinator  or your au pair bestie  these individuals will ideally be excellent listeners and wonderful encouragers who can help you remember the reasons you decided to become an au pair in the first place.  Remember  not every day will feel completely balanced. Some days  you’ll feel like you worked more than you like. On other days  you’ll be living the dream you once envisioned of seeing a new and beautiful place with your best friend. Your ability to balance overall  weekly  and monthly  is vital for you to have a healthy work-life balance as an au pair in the USA. Marisa is a lover of all things cultural exchange.

Au Pair Insurance: What You Need to Know!,There’s a lot to think about when you’re living abroad as an au pair: your host family  your new neighborhood and home  the weather  the culture  the food  the travel. But not many au pairs give a lot of thought to what their medical coverage will be while on program. With the numerous documents being sent your way to review  the excitement of packing your suitcases and saying goodbye to your loved ones  and settling into your new community  you may not remember to review everything that comes along with your au pair insurance. Or  if you’ve been on program for a while  you may have forgotten how your au pair insurance works if you don’t need to use it until months after your arrival.  Here are some quick reminders and things to consider when it comes to au pair insurance during your program year in the U.S.: You never know when you may need it! Your ID card is proof of insurance and will be asked for anytime you visit a doctor or hospital. Au Pair USA recommends keeping a copy in your wallet and another in your home with your other important documents  like your passport and Social Security card. If you’re feeling sick  it is recommended to visit an Urgent Care rather than a hospital. Your bill will be a lot less expensive  and your visit will probably be a lot quicker too. You can easily find which doctors are in-network providers by searching for the type of care you need along with your zip code in theStudent Zone. While prescription medicine cost is usually reimbursed under your insurance  medication for a pre-existing condition (a medical illness or need you had prior to coming to the U.S.) will likely not be covered under your plan. You also will need to pay for any and all prescriptions upfront and submit a claim for reimbursement.Note that the cost of prescription drugs may be considerably higher in the United States than in your home country. As with any insurance plan  there will be limitations as to what is included and what is not. Read through your coverage details in depth and ensure you understand these exclusions well. They may make you reconsider certain high-risk activities before you opt to do them during your stay. Au pairs have the option toupgrade their au pair insuranceto the premium plan before arrival or within the first seven days on program. Should you have any insurance questions  you can visit theStudent Zoneor contact your Local Coordinator. Marisa is a lover of all things cultural exchange.

3 Ways for Au Pairs to Communicate Effectively with Their Host Family,As an au pair it is so important to have open and honest communication with your host family  but sometimes it isn’t the easiest task to complete! Not only are you and your host family often busy  but some topics can feel a little awkward or strange to bring up  especially in someone else’s home  in a foreign country whose culture you’re still learning about  and in a language that may not be your native tongue. Withover 30 yearsof supporting au pairs and host families through thousands of successful matches Au Pair USAhas some essential communication tips to share when it comes to successfully interacting with your host family: Ask your host family to schedule a weekly meeting with you to review how the week went. This is best completed in the evening after the kids go to sleep so you and your host parents have time to communicate without interruption. Invite your host family to provide you any feedback (both positive and constructive). It’s important for you to know whether or not you’re meeting their expectations. This also creates a safe space for you to open up about your feedback or any concerns you may be having in the placement. It’s best to be open and honest about any issues early on so you can both work toward resolution  rather than repressing those feelings and letting them create resentment.  Remember that as an au pair you are part of a cultural exchange program. As you know from living in the U.S.  many things are different: the food  the driving  even the way people communicate. Don’t jump to conclusions and take offense to a comment that may not have been meant to make you upset. Remember that not everything said will always translate 100%  and Americans may communicate differently than you’re used to  especially when providing feedback or expressing concerns. If you’re not feeling good about the way something was communicated to you  be curious and ask what your host family meant by the information shared. Express how it made you feel. And try to give them the benefit of the doubt before deciding in your mind that their comment was meant to be offensive.  Talk to yourLocal Coordinatorduring monthly check-ins. If you spoke with your host family about a concern  let your Local Coordinator know. If you’re concerned about speaking with your host family about something  also let them know. Your Local Coordinator can offer guidance and support when it comes to communication and resolving any potential issues with your host family. Your Local Coordinator may have experience with similar situations and is a trusted resource with expertise and knowledge even your host family may not have. They’re also familiar with U.S.Department of State guidelinesand are there to ensure your safety and success as an au pair.  Effective communication is the foundation for a successful relationship with your host family. By proactively meeting  being open minded  and confiding in yourAu Pair USALocal Coordinator  you can ensure you and your host family are communicating effectively and creating a harmonious environment for everyone involved. Remember  good communication takes effort from both sides  so be patient  understanding  and willing to adapt. If you have any questions about communicating effectively after reading  be sure to ask your Local Coordinator who can help guide you in the right direction.

Eat, Play, Give: Exchange Day 2023,Exchange Dayis a worldwide celebration of the power of global cultural exchange. International exchange participants—including au pairs—and community members come together to “eat  play  and give.” They share cultural diversity and American traditions  give back to their local communities  and have some fun together.Exchange Dayis also an opportunity to showcase international exchange programs and spread the word about the importance of cultural exchange. InterExchangehas been celebrating Exchange Day since 2015  after the first annual celebration was hosted in 2014. This year Au Pair USAau pairs had the opportunity to participate in events in a number of cities including  Stamford  Connecticut; Germantown  Maryland; New York  New York; Dayton  Ohio; and Glen Ellyn  Illinois to name a few. AsInterExchangeoffices are based inNew York City  it’s no surprise this event was one of the largest hosted this year. Both exchange participants and InterExchange staff gathered atGod’s Love We Deliverin Manhattan.  God’s Love cooks and home-delivers nutritious  medically tailored meals for people too sick to shop or cook for themselves. They also provide unlimited nutrition education and counseling. Volunteers spent the day in the kitchen helping on-staff chefs with a variety of projects. “I always like to help people ” says au pair  Carla  from Mexico  “and when I saw that they have an event to help people and have fun I didn’t want to lose the opportunity. My favorite part was to meet new people and see how easy it’s to help others.” WhileExchange Dayis typically celebrated the second Monday of August Au Pair USAau pairs enjoy exercising the “Eat  Play  Give” mantra throughout the year. Since the start of 2023  Local Coordinators have organized a number of events and opportunities for au pairs to give back to their communities through acts of service  sharing their culture and learning about American customs—and  of course  having a great time meeting others and connecting in doing so. Some of these past events have included volunteering at a San Diego food pantry  hosting a potluck picnic at a park in Seattle  and handing out water to runners at the L.A. Marathon. TheInterExchangeteam is honored to continue engaging our community in celebrating the power of international and cultural exchange programs  to create meaningful cultural experiences for our participants  and to facilitate deeper connections with their host communities in the U.S. We look forward to even more ways to give back on futureExchange Daysand throughout the year.

Au Pair Sings Her Heart Out,Nana  a Japanese au pair  has loved to sing for as long as she can remember. Back in her home country  though  Nana felt shy and embarrassed to sing for anyone. Even though it was always Nana’s dream to sing publicly  her shyness held her back. Now that she is living in the U.S.  however  she’s not only singing  she’s performing! I really wanted to sing in Japan. I felt shy because so many people know me there. I didn’t have confidence to sing there. When I came to the U.S. I started singing because I love to sing. At first I was just singing for myself. Then  I started posting on my social media. The confidence didn’t come overnight for Nana though. At first  she questioned if she could do it. Fortunately  she was encouraged by those around her: her friends she met while studying at the local university and her host family.  Nana also noticed a cultural difference here in the U.S. She witnessed people around her doing things they loved without fear or judgment. This gave her the courage to go for it. From there  Nana said she got excited about the idea of singing for a live audience. “I wanted to see their reactions when I sing. Singing has a lot of power. It can cheer people up. It can make them happy. It can be very touching.” Since finding the courage to perform for an audience  Nana has achieved some major singing goals  including performing in Grand Central Station. Recently  Nana sang there while playing her ukulele. It’s incredible to think Nana performed in the middle of one of the biggest travel hubs in the entire country as one of her first gigs! I was really happy. Some of my friends came. The happiest part was when strangers stopped and watched and stayed until the end of the performance. I even got a tip! For now  Nana continues to nurture her singing dreams by performing for local audiences when she’s not busy taking care of her host kids and studying at the university. She’s enjoying gaining lots of valuable experience in the singing world while living in the U.S. Her next major singing milestone will be to audition for amateur night at the famous Apollo Theatre in New York City. What’s next for Nana when she finishes up the au pair program? “I would like to find an agent when I return to Japan to promote me ” she says. Looks like Nana’s not shy to sing anymore! Go  Nana  go! For future au pairs  Nana’s advice is clear and simple: No one judges you (here in the U.S.)  so if you like to do something or there’s something you enjoy  don’t worry about other people. Just enjoy what you like to do and do it. We’re so glad Nana followed her own advice! Marisa is a lover of all things cultural exchange.

Five Ways for Kids to Avoid Screen Time This Summer,Did you know that according to theAmerican Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry  the average child between the ages of eight and 12 spends four to six hours a day on a screen? While screens can be entertaining and even help educate children  too much use may lead to problems  like lower grades in school and lack of quality sleep. As an au pair  it can feel like a lot of pressure to avoid screen time throughout a ten-hour workday  especially now that the summer season has arrived! How can you entertain your host child for that long? Without school  it can feel daunting to come up with ways to play all day. Look no further! Here are five ways au pairs can avoid using screen time with their host kids this summer: Include activities such as reading  doing simple chores  or working on some academic skills that earn your kids points  stickers  or some other form of “currency” they can cash in for rewards. Check out thisrecent blog postwith more information to get started. When temptation is out of sight  it’s also out of mind. Your kids will likely ask less to watch TV or play video games if they’re not seeing those electronics throughout the day. Go for a bike ride  spend time at the park  have a picnic  run through the sprinkler. The possibilities for outdoor fun are endless! Ask your host parents if you can set up playdates with your host kids’ friends or au pair friends and their host kids. Playing with friends can be a great way for kids to pass lots of time without boredom or wanting to fill in hours of playing on a tablet. Some of the most fun ways to pass time are basic games you may have played as a kid. These can include simple card games  Simon Says  board games  and fort building with couch cushions just to name a few. Your positive attitude toward these activities will set the mood for kids to be excited and want to participate. Don’t be on your phone during the workday. Kids emulate the behavior of grown-ups around them  so be sure to set the right example. Phones can be addictive but you’ll need to keep your checking to a minimum and only for the purpose of host family communication throughout the day. Avoid checking social media or email during your workday. What are some of your best ways to avoid screen time with your host kids?Let us know! Marisa is a lover of all things cultural exchange.

Fun Summer Activities for Kids,Summer has arrived! School’s out  the weather’s warm  and kids are ready to have some serious fun! As an au pair  you may need new ideas or welcome some tips when it comes to creating fun  entertaining summer activities for your host kids. Lucky for you Au Pair USAhas put together aPinterest boardcomplete with tons of activity options that are simple  creative  and guaranteed to make your summer with your host kids full of fun memories. Some of these suggestions may be a bit messy  so be sure to run these ideas by your host family before implementing them! Here are a few of our favorites: Work with your host kids to create a list of things you want to do together this summer. These can include things like playing mini golf  having a scavenger hunt  cooking a new recipe  building a fort  etc. You can even get fancy and make it colorful and artistic! Post the summer bucket list somewhere in your host family’s home where everyone can see it. Anytime you’re unsure what to do  use the bucket list as a guide to help you stay on track with summer fun goals.  Tennis is a great summer sport  but you may not have access to a court  a racket  or even tennis balls. Plus  your host kids may not have the hand/eye coordination yet to play tennis either. A fun way to play tennis a bit differently includes using paper plates  popsicle sticks  and a balloon. Super simple and super fun!  Squirt guns can be a great way to beat the heat  but did you know you can also use them for art projects? Use water color  water  and inexpensive squirt guns to paint in a fun and creative style.  If water won’t cool you down in the summer  ice definitely will! This activity will keep the little ones busy and engaged without a mess. Freeze a bunch of their small toys in a big plastic container with water. Then  pop it out and give them some safe ‘archeology’ tools to dig out the treasures.  You’ve heard of tie-dye shirts  but what about shoes? This method is simple  creative  and less messy than traditional tie dye. You’ll just need a pair of white  canvas sneakers (you can usually find inexpensive ones at stores likeWalmartorKmart)  colorful Sharpie markers  some rubbing alcohol and a dropper or spray bottle. Bonus: you can wear your art all summer long to the park  on walks  or just out and about!  A simple craft that can be the start of some summer bird watching to follow. With just a few supplies (most may even be on hand already)  you can create a bird feeder  fill it with some bird seed  then enjoy catching those birds in action as they come pay you a visit in your yard. Take it a step further and ask your kids to draw the birds they see or write about them in a bird watching journal.  Au Pair USAhopes your summer is off to a great start and that you’re having fun creating lots of memories with your host kids. These are just a few ways to enjoy the summer season with your host children. What would youadd to our list? Marisa is a lover of all things cultural exchange.

Au Pair Tips for Driving in the U.S.,It can be intimidating to drive in another country. It can make you even more nervous to be driving someone’s children as part of your au pair job. While the core components of driving are relatively similar in all parts of the world Au Pair USAis happy to provide you with some tips for becoming a confident and capable driver in the U.S. Not only will reading the following information be helpful  our Academy training and resources are always available to review whenever you need a refresher about American driving. Before you begin driving or even arrive  it’s a good idea to ask your host family any questions you may have about driving their car (and their children) specifically. For example  Your host family will provide you with all the information you need to feel comfortable getting behind the wheel  and most importantly  driving their children. Take notes  take photos  research information  and start studying the traffic laws in your U.S. home state so you can feel as prepared as possible when it’s time to start officially driving. When it’s time to start practicing driving  remember to start slow. No matter how long you’ve been driving in your home country  you’re in a new place now  in a different car with different rules  signs  and signals. Consider starting in an empty parking lot  as if you were just learning to drive. Then  go to some residential  quiet streets. Once you’re comfortable there  begin driving on main roads and highways if your host family agrees. It’s always important toavoid distractionswhile driving. Ensure you are not using your cell phone or become distracted by the radio or a friend or child in the car. If someone or something needs your attention  pull over safely to manage the situation. U.S. laws are likely different when it comes to driving and driving with children. Children always sit in the back seat unless they’ve reached a weight/height requirement to move to the front passenger seat. Many will also use car seats or boosters until they’ve also reached a weight/height requirement. Babies’ car seats are recommended to face backwards for at least a year (often longer). And children are never to be left alone in a car  not even for a minute! Not only is this illegal  but it can be life threatening  too  as children overheat more quickly than adults do.The National Safety CouncilandAu Pair USAprovidegreat remindersfor safety on this topic. Remember  driving as an au pair is a privilege and big responsibility. Ensure you’re following your host family’s rules when it comes to car usage. For example: Au Pair USAoffers tons more information and resources to prepare au pairs for driving in the U.S. Be sure to visit your passport portal and access additional training information to ensure you feel confident to start driving during your au pair year.

Dancing His Way Through the Au Pair Experience,Italo DeLucca  a 26-year-old Brazilian au pair  is truly the epitome ofmaking the mostof his au pair experience. When he arrived in the U.S. on January 6  2022  he was excited to improve his English  experience life in the U.S.  and take care of his host children. It felt like a dream! Shortly after  he started to experience homesickness and culture shock  which is not uncommon for au pairs to face during their time abroad. Coming from a tropical climate to being in freezing temperatures in New York City’s winter was a big shift. Layer in Italo’s shyness and slow start to making friends plus missing his home  he wasn’t sure he’d make it the whole year.  In March  Italo realized a resource he wasn’t tapping into that could turn everything around for him. He started searching for a local K-pop dance group to join. K-pophad been a passion of his since pre-pandemic times. He’d discovered this genre of music a while back in Brazil. Despite its lack of popularity in his small city  Italo began learning the dances alone in his room. He then found a group to join and dance with  although he had to drive over 100km to get there. He applied to join a number of K-pop groups. He completed the forms and made some demo videos.  By May 2022  he had auditioned and was quickly accepted as a member. As months went on  Italo joined other K-pop groups as well. “We all have the same goal  which is to film and post on Youtube. Even though many of the groups have the same people  each group has a different style.” Joining these groups allowed Italo not only to make close friends with similar interests during his au pair experience  but also to pursue his passion for dancing K-pop. Some people use dance to express themselves. I see it as exercise and a way to have fun. I love the music style  outfits  and choreography. I have so much joy doing it. This is also healing my inner child and my inner teenager. It’s something I’ve always wanted to do—to dance with people and be seen. I’m having fun and I’m making a dream come true for my younger self.  Italo is now on his extension year in the au pair program and will return to Brazil in January 2024. Fortunately  since the pandemic  K-pop has grown a lot in the state where he is from. No more driving 100km for practice! Based on social media I can see lots of friends doing the same thing I’m doing here. So  I think it will be easier for me to join them when I return since there are more options. I can also start my own since I now have the experience of dancing in NYC. Italo’s advice to future au pairs… It might be hard at first  but you’ll find your tribe. You’ll find where you belong. I am really  really shy. But  I knew I needed to work on that  especially if I wanted to dance. Don’t give up. If you find something you want to do: cooking  dancing  arts and crafts  anything you want to do and people invite you to join them  put your shyness aside. It will all be worth it. If it wasn’t for my K-pop group  I probably wouldn’t be here in my second year enjoying myself so much. This is an amazing experience and you won’t regret it.

An Au Pair’s Journey to Entrepreneurship,Katie Hulme  a formerAu Pair USAau pair from the United Kingdom  credits so much of her life experience and now career choices to heryear of cultural exchangein the United States. Kate has always loved kids. Her first job as an au pair was actually in Italy in 2011. She was studying child development and looking for a summer job to gain some hands-on experience. Her job search led her to Orvieto  Italy as an au pair  and she ended up staying much longer than just the summer. After nannying for some years  Katie came to the U.S. as an au pair in 2016 and took care of three children  ages two  three  and seven. Katie says  (They are) the best kids in the world.~Katie Hulme In 2022  after 13 years as a career nanny  she opened up her own home daycare calledWildflowersin September 2022. In fact  Katie attributes a lot of her success to her experience participating in the au pair program. The au pair program gave me the chance to experience so many different cultures and parenting styles  it really opened my eyes and gave me a fresh perspective. It set me up for all the success I have had  as a career nanny landing jobs with VIPs  and even now creating my own business. Everyone I met along the way has shaped the person I am today.~ Katie Hulme Of course  Katie has gained some valuable childcare experience as anau pair and nanny  and now an entrepreneur  but what being au pair taught her the most… “Resilience. The au pair program was amazing but challenging at times. Being away from home  from your home comforts  missing your friends and family can be really tough. But I learned to appreciate where I was  the opportunities I was presented with and to adapt to the changes and be grateful for them.”~ Katie Hulme Katie’s advice to current or future au pairs: Do it. Don’t look back. Appreciate every moment. Time goes so fast  and you’ll never get those experiences back. Ready tostart your next adventure as an au pairin the USA?

Au Pairs Volunteer at the Los Angeles Marathon,This past March Au Pair USALocal Coordinator and former au pair Anderson Camargo took his group of Southern California au pairs to volunteer at theLos Angeles Marathon. Anderson heard about the opportunity through theU.S. Department of Stateand thought it would be a unique way to host a monthlycluster eventwhile giving back to the community. Anderson coached his au pairs that volunteering at the event would be a lot of work. They’d have to wake up early  arriving by 6:45 a.m.  but there was a possibility they’d also see some celebrities running throughout the day. Despite the necessary early rising  Anderson said: The energy was great. We walked half a mile and arrived at the water station. We received instructions and volunteer shirts. We started to set up water tables by filling up cups and lining them up in multiple rows. Then we waited for runners to start arriving.~ Anderson Camargo Anderson recalled that over 60 local au pairs present from various agencies were there  chatting and getting to know each other. It was an incredible opportunity to experience cultural exchange not just from a U.S. perspective  but from a global one with au pairs from all over the world working together. As the competitive runners started arriving  everyone was excited to give them the water. Anderson’s group of au pairs were placed at Mile Marker 24  with a slight uphill leading up to them. He recalls many runners were tired. “They were exhausted at this point. They only had two more miles to go.”~ Anderson Camargo After a few hours  more and more runners made their way past their mile marker. Au pairs started energetically shouting “Water!” to help bring the runners’ attention to the resources available. An incredible insight Anderson noticed was the au pairs’ ability to work as a team with little to no instruction. “Around 11-12  we were running out of water. The sea of people had been coming in  so we needed to refresh our supply. We established a process. Everyone did what they had to do. If they noticed cups were low  they’d fill them without needing direction. If they needed to clean up  they’d do it without being told. These young adults are really awesome.”~ Anderson Camargo So  did Anderson and his au pairs end up seeing any celebrities during their busy time volunteering at the LA marathon? Well  Anderson thinks he sawDiplo  but he isn’t sure since he was focused on cleaning up during that moment. Also  he says it was hard to recognize other celebrities as many people were wearing sunglasses as they whizzed by. After an incredible experience volunteering at the LA marathon  Anderson says: “I wish I had events like this to participate in when I was an au pair. This was my first time volunteering at the LA marathon and I think this will be a regular thing for me every year.”~ Anderson Camargo Want to experience cultural exchange opportunities like this?

From Au Pair to Head of Human Resources,When Alejandra decided to become an au pair in 2021  she was working in the psychology field in Mexico. She had gotten her degree in child psychology a few years earlier and had an affinity for supporting the mental health of children and parents alike. Alejandra thought a year in the U.S. would help deepen her understanding of a different culture in a different part of the world  but what was especially interesting to this child psychology graduate was learning about children in another country. Alejandra arrived in Seattle in April 2021 and began taking care of two amazing kids  ages four and two. Through her au pair experience  she learned the obvious things you imagine any au pair on a cultural exchange program in the U.S. picks up: American culture  the English language  the history of the Thanksgiving holiday. And yet  Alejandra took away so much more than just these basics. “Being an au pair allowed me to know how to build relationships with different kinds of people and different cultures. It allowed me to learn how to communicate better.” When Alejandra returned to Mexico in 2022  she decided to shift careers and step into human resources. She now holds a position as Head of HR for a logistics company. “When people think of human resources  they think of administrative processes  but I think it’s really important because you are responsible for people  how they’re feeling  how satisfied they are at work. If you have experience with relationships with different kinds of people  you have the key on how to effectively do this role.” When asked about the most important thing she learned from the au pair program  Alejandra said it was empathy. Alejandra has been able to bring this value of a better understanding of those around her into her career success. “The au pair program changes your mind completely. You think differently. You understand different cultures. You’re more empathetic.” Let’s not forget those obvious skills too! Alejandra did improve her English quite a bit while participating in the au pair program and she now also teaches Spanish to American teachers living in Mexico. She jokes that many of her friends are American  even though she’s living in Mexico. It can be scary to leave your life and participate in the au pair program  especially if you’ve already graduated and have started your career. But  take it from someone like Alejandra: “Life experience helps you. The program allows you to know yourself  and if you know yourself you have more opportunities in your work because you have the ability to know how to be in different situations in life.” If you’re ready to get started on your au pair adventure we can help! Au Pair USA has been successfully placing au pairs with carefully screened American host families for over 30 years. We’re looking forward to supporting you in your au pair journey.

The Power of Translation: Au Pair Sofia’s Story as a New York City Marathon Interpreter,When Sofia arrived in the U.S. as an au pair in August 2022 from Spain  she was excited to participate in a cultural exchange experience like the au pair program. “I had never done an Erasmus program and wanted to participate in one.” At 24  she felt mature enough to travel across the globe and not feel overly homesick. Shortly after her arrival to Brooklyn  New York  Sofia’s Local Coordinator (LC) offered her and otherAu Pair USAau pairs the opportunity to be volunteers at theNew York City Marathon. Most volunteers would be handing out water to runners alongside the course  but Sofia noticed a volunteer position that might suit her even better. She read there was a need for medical interpreters. Since she had been a translation professional back in Spain she decided to apply. “I didn’t know if I’d even have a chance to be selected since I graduated in another country. They answered three weeks before the marathon that I had been and gave us next steps  including a training program to learn about how to manage that day and what would be expected of us. I made a glossary of the specific vocabulary  since I’m not a doctor and wasn’t used to some of the words.” Sofia was placed at the finish line checkpoint location. It was busy all day because  as Sofia says  “People were determined to finish the race  no matter their medical conditions.” As runners began needing support earlier in the day  they requested interpreters over the loudspeaker by language  but by the end they were calling Sofia over the loudspeaker by name. Sofia thinks she was able to support more than 50 runners by translating their medical conditions that day! Sofia translated French  Italian and Spanish. Sometimes she was translating from one non-native language to another  which was challenging. “It was difficult  I needed to remain very focused. Then I’d get called to another patient and need to switch my brain into another language and do it again.” Sofia developed a personal relationship with the medical team  which was truly a memorable part of the experience. Dr. Calvin Sun  physician  author ofThe Monsoon Diaries  and captain of the tent that day  wrote Sofia a personal email congratulating her and thanking her for her support  welcoming her back to participate the following year. This was meaningful for Sofia as it gave her additional confidence in the work she had done that day. Sofia would give this advice to future au pairs: “I recommend looking for opportunities. It will be useful for your future to take advantage of as many opportunities as possible. Volunteering is even nicer than working because it makes you feel very useful and you are giving something to this country. The U.S. is giving us the opportunity to live here  so it’s an action by giving something back to the country.” Marisa is a lover of all things cultural exchange.

Meet Au Pair USA’s 2022 Super Au Pair Finalist, Nana!,Before deciding to become an au pair Super Au Pairfinalist Nana was a kindergarten teacher in Japan. She thought coming to the U.S. would be a great opportunity to use her childcare skills  improve her English and experience a new culture. Since her arrival in March 2022  her au pair experience has by far exceeded those expectations. “My host family has been like a real family  taking me to different places and going out on weekends. That makes me very happy and is one of my favorite things about living in the U.S.” Nana’s host family thinks she is a super au pair because caring for two toddlers (one and three years old) with lots of energy is no easy job. Her host mom says  “We just love how caring and kind she is with the kids and all the fun projects she does with them  such as painting  cooking  teaching them to play the piano and teaching them Japanese words.” Nana’s host child  who is just three years old  says  “Good morning” to her in Japanese every day! Nana has made so many wonderful memories in her program year through this cultural exchange experience. “I love American culture! Because of holidays like Halloween and Christmas  events are so fun in the USA!” Her favorite part of being an au pair  though  has undoubtedly been watching her host kids grow. When Nana arrived  her host children were three years old and six months old. Seeing her host baby learn to walk and talk especially and seeing her other host child learn to love school when he was initially scared to go were some of the most special milestones Nana says she experienced during her program year. Nana never imagined she’d be selected as Au Pair USA’s Super Au Pair Finalist. When her host mom told her the news  she was very surprised! It was just another way the au pair experience has exceeded her expectations. Nana’s au pair program will come to an end this March  and she has dreams of visiting Australia after her return to Japan. Nana says of all things  she will miss her host family most  but plans to remain in contact via texting  video calls and social media. Congratulations  Nana  on being a 2022 Super Au Pair Finalist!

Meet Au Pair USA’s 2022 Super Au Pair Finalist, Ariane!,Super Au Pair Finalist Ariane from Brazil wasn’t even sure she’d be able to participate in the program and arrive at her host family’s home when she found herself in a Brazilian hospital the day before her flight to the U.S. Ariane apologetically called her host family hours before she had planned to board her flight  nervous what their reaction would be. Could they wait for her medical crisis to be resolved? Ariane knew they needed an au pair right away. To her delight  the first words her host family spoke after hearing about the situation was  “Ariane  you are our au pair. We are going to wait for you.”  Two weeks later Ariane arrived in good health and ready to get started. Since Ariane’s arrival in April 2022  she and her host family have bonded over a number of common interests. For one  they’re both avid scouts and campers. Ariane often joins her host family on camping trips and has even led scout meetings for her host children. Everyone in the home loves learning about other cultures andlanguages. Ariane often cooks Brazilian foods for her host family  visits Brazilian bakeries with her host kids  teaches them to say words and phrases in Portuguese  and even gets regular requests for her famous Brazilianbrigadeirosweet treats for everyone’s birthdays. “It’s not just the birthdays  it’s the whole birthday week: the birthday party and the actual birthday”  Ariane says with a smile. Ariane has also learned more than she thought she would when it comes to cultural exchange. Since her host children study French and Spanish  she is picking up two new languages in providinghomework helpfor the kids as part of her afternoon routine. Ariane really stepped up to the plate when her host dad had to travel for 5 weeks this past fall. She was an invaluable resource to her host mom and host children  helping with back-to-school routines and co-parenting support. Her host dad said  “Ariane was there to support my wife and my family  not just to get them where they needed to go  but also for emotional support.” Ariane says her host family has exceeded all her expectations of what she imagined her au pair experience would be like. They treat her like a true member of the family. She enjoys having dinner with them each night and spending quality time together on the weekends  even when she’s not working. “I spend time with them because I like to be with them. We have a really good relationship. It’s more than just work.” Congratulations  Ariane  on being a 2022 Super Au Pair Finalist!WatchAriane’s story and others.

Meet Lena, Au Pair USA’s 2022 Super Au Pair!,From the moment you connect with Lena  it’s easy to see why their host family nominated them  and they were ultimately selected as Au Pair USA’s Super Au Pair. Lena has a calming and positive energy  a sincere and honest demeanor  and an empathetic and graceful way of communicating. When Lena arrived on program in November 2021  they knew the basics of what to expect from the au pair program. Their best friend had completed an au pair year and filled them in on all the details of culture  schedule  education  socialization  etc. What Lena didn’t expect was what would transpire just a few months later. Shortly after their arrival  Lena’s host child was diagnosed with lymphoma. Just as their au pair routine was starting to form  everything changed. Instead of taking their host child to and from school  Lena would spend weeks at a time visiting her in the hospital. Instead of having a carefree social schedule  Lena would be making more cautious decisions about their interactions with friends or in crowded spaces to account for their immunocompromised child during chemo treatments. But  as Lena says  “I was just trying to make it as easy as possible for my host family.” Making sacrifices in their social life to not add any additional stress to their host parents’ plate was a no-brainer decision Lena made for the benefit of the situation  alongside many others. Lena thought  “If this is something I can do to help my host family  I’m going to do it.” Perhaps the most admirable choice Lena made was when they decided to shave their head with their host child to make the experience less scary and more fun. Lena explained how their host child had always had long hair and was nervous about losing it during chemotherapy. They started giving her shorter and shorter haircuts and one day all decided (Lena  host child  and host dad) that they would shave their heads together. The host family set up a mini salon in their kitchen. Lena’s host mom shaved Lena’s head. Lena remembers the experience vividly  especially seeing all the different hair colors on the ground afterwards when it was time to clean up the hair mess! Lena is now in their extension year of their au pair program. It’s been such a different experience than they could have ever imagined  but Lena continues to see the positive throughout it all. For example  Lena said  “What I realized during the months of treatment is that I would have never gotten to know my host kid the way I did if she had just been going to school. I feel grateful I really got the chance to form such a close bond with her when I was spending time with her in the hospital.” Lena’s host child completed chemo in May 2022 and has been thriving post treatment. She says  “I really think Lena is a great au pair. She makes really good snacks  like tacos and she helps me get my reading and math done in a fun way.” What more could you ask for in a Super Au Pair?WatchLena’s story and others.

Understanding American Holiday Culture,This post was originally published in December 2015 and revised by other contributors in December 2024. The holiday season is upon us! Here’s a quick overview of holidays celebrated in the U.S. to to get you acclimated to some of fall’s main celebrations  American style: This holiday gives children the opportunity to dress up in their scariest (or prettiest  or wackiest) outfits  while running around the neighborhood  yelling “trick or treat!” and filling pillowcases with fun-sized chocolates and candies. Take note that many people of all ages celebrateHalloween. Don’t be surprised if almost everyone on your block is handing out candy  if your children wear costumes to a school event  or even if your host parents or you get invited to a Halloween party! However  some families choose not to celebrate Halloween for religious reasons. Be sure you and your host family are on the same page before making jack-o-lanterns with the kids! Thanksgiving  or “Turkey Day” as you may hear it referred to  commemorates a feast shared by both indigenous Americans and early Pilgrims to the New World. This day brings American families together to cook a massive feast  eat it together  view a football game  and to remember to give thanks for the food  family  and other good fortune they have. Many workers are given a day off on both Thursday and Friday. During this holiday  many Americans make the journey back to their hometowns or to the cities where other loved ones live in an effort to share with their family. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics Thanksgiving is the most heavily traveled time of year! While not an official holiday  Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving and is worth mentioning here. It’s the biggest sale day of the year for shopping! Nearly every store offers lower pricing on their products on Black Friday in preparation for gift buyers starting their Christmas  Hanukkah  and Kwanzaa shopping. Be sure to take advantage of some of these deals  but also beware: stores are crowded  lines are long  and high-demand products may sell out quickly. If crowded shopping isn’t your thing  don’t worry. Most stores will offer online savings as well! This eight-day festival of lights commemorates the rededication of the holy Temple in Jerusalem after the reclamation from Greek-Syrian conquerors. Jewish families celebrate Hanukkah by lighting thehanukkiah(usually referred to as amenorah). Each night at sundown  another candle is lit until at the end of the celebration all of the eight candles are glowing (the candle in the middle is used to light the others  so there are nine in total). Families also exchange gifts each evening and share traditional foods such as potato pancakes  calledlatkes  and jelly-filled doughnuts. People of all ages  but especially children  love playingdreideland giving outgelt! While a traditionally Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ  the celebration of Christmas has integrated itself into secular United States culture. Don’t be surprised to see garland  bows  fake snow  bells  Santa  and signs wishing everyone a “Merry Christmas!” or “Happy Holidays!” around your city. There are many Americans who do not celebrate Christmas. If you’re not sure if someone celebrates Christmas or not  it’s good form to tell people “Happy Holidays!” rather than “Merry Christmas!” Christmas is a time for gift-giving and sharing a meal with family. Much like Thanksgiving  this is a big time for travel. Many people do their best to make it “home for Christmas” – even if it is the only time of the year that they see their family. Children will eagerly await the arrival of Santa Claus  who – the story goes – comes down the chimney on Christmas Eve in order to stuff children’s stockings with goodies and leave gifts under the Christmas tree! Kwanzaais a weeklong celebration that honors African heritage in African-American culture. Kwanzaa is observed from December 26th to January 1st  and ends with a celebratory meal and gift exchange. Kwanzaa is a relatively newer holiday than Hanukkah or Christmas  having begun in 1966.There are seven principles  which coordinate with the seven days and seven candles that are lit throughout the week: Umoja (unity)  Kujichagulia (self-determination)  Ujima (collective work and responsibility)  Ujamaa (cooperative economics)  Nia (purpose)  Kuumba (creativity) and Imani (faith). Kwanzaa is not a religious holiday. New Year’s Eve is a night to celebrate the past year and welcome the new one! Depending on your host family’s plans  you may have the night off to hang out with friends  or you might be working so your host parents can enjoy a party or event for adults only  since New Year’s events usually don’t end until after midnight. No matter your plans  it will be a New Year’s Eve to remember—one you spent in the U.S. The holiday season can be a busy time of year  filled with many parties  events  and social gatherings. Whether the holidays you celebrate during your au pair program year are similar to or different from what you’ve experienced before  the holiday season is a wonderful time to experience cultural exchange with new family and friends. Be intentional about participating in these experiences. You’ll create so many wonderful new memories by doing so!

Achieving a Tall Goal During His Au Pair Year,When Philipp (21) from Austria arrived on the Au Pair program in January 2022  he didn’t know he’d be challenging himself to achieve one of the biggest goals of his lifetime to date  climbing to the top of Mount Rainier in Washington state (over 14 000 feet above sea level). Philipp joined the au pair program because he wanted to get more childcare experience and improve his spoken English. One day  he’d like to be a kindergarten teacher. But  he’s also got other goals and interests besides these. When he was 13 years old  he started rock climbing and hiking mountains with his dad. Austria is not a bad place to grow up if you’ve got a hobby like this. When he became an adult  he joined the high mountain infantry in the Austrian army and continued practicing his passion for climbing. Before arriving in Washington state  where he now lives and takes care of his two host children  he didn’t know much about mountain climbing life in the U.S. From his drive from the airport to his host family’s home; however  he caught sight of Mount Rainier and knew climbing it was something he was interested in doing during his stay. “Be prepared  both physically and mentally. And take the first step by asking about it. Also  budget accordingly because it can be expensive.” The mountain seemed majestic to him. It was bigger and higher than any other mountain he has ever climbed before. Philipp was ready for the challenge. He asked his host family about it  and they said they liked to hike  but their neighbor was more of an expert so he should ask him. Philipp did and ended up training with his new neighbor every weekend for the next four months. With any major climb  it’s important to find an organization to go with for safety and support. Philipp researched and found an organization calledClimb for Hope  which raises money for cancer research. It was important to him that this climb had more meaning than just his fulfilling a personal goal. “I wanted to do something good  not just for me”  Philipp said. And he did  raising over $4 000 in donations for his climb. On the morning of June 27  2022  Philipp and five other climbers (including his neighbor and two guides) began their four-day trek up Mount Rainier. The climb included hiking on ice throughout the night while it was frozen and less dangerous than when the sun melted it during the day and camping. It was grueling at times  and Philipp would be lying if he didn’t think of turning around at some points  but he was committed to reaching the top and achieving this incredible goal. When he reached the summit  Philipp says it was hard to describe. He felt exhausted and dizzy. It was hard to breathe up there. He was even a little confused. In Austria  he was used to pointy peaks  but because this was a volcano  the summit was more of a crater. He couldn’t really believe it. It felt surreal. Philipp said it took about two more days for it all to sink in that he had just climbed the tallest mountain he’d ever climbed before. What’s next for Philipp? Well  he’d love to climb Mount St. Helen or Mount Whitney in the future. He’s not stopping! For any future au pairs who arrive with an eagerness for adventure and challenge yourselves in such a way  Philipp says  “Be prepared  both physically and mentally. And take the first step by asking about it. Also  budget accordingly because it can be expensive.” To learn more about joining the au pair program  you can get started by applyinghere.

Top 5 Places for Au Pairs to Visit in the U.S. During the Fall,Fall is here! Now might be the perfect time to plan a trip to see a new part of the U.S. during your au pair program. Since many families are tied to the school calendar  fall is not typical vacation season  which means there are fewer tourists and possibly better deals to travel. Check outAu Pair USA’stop 5 destinations for au pairs to visit in the U.S. during the fall: Autumn is the prime time to explore Portland because of its moderate weather and beautiful scenery. There are beautiful forests to hike and waterfalls to explore. Portland also has an independent theatre and showcases major musical productions if you like seeing plays. Au pair Jessica (26  England)  recommends visiting Multnomah Falls. “You can see it from the freeway  but I would recommend parking and walking across the bridge. It’s about 30 minutes from Portland  but amazing and worth visiting!” Fall is a great time to see the Grand Canyon for a number of reasons  the most important being: fewer crowds and more comfortable temperatures. Summer can be extremely hot  but fall allows for hiking throughout the day. You might also be able to experience some fall foliage if you hit the North Rim. Au pair Paul (24  South Africa) said  “The view was the absolute best part of visiting the Grand Canyon.” He also recommends getting accommodations close by so you can get there early enough to see the sunrise. Whether you choose to hike among fall foliage  take a scenic drive through multi-colored forests  or celebrate the fall harvest with pumpkins  corn mazes  and apple cider  you won’t regret taking a trip to beautiful Asheville  NC. Au pair Aline (25  Brazil) says  “Without a doubt  theCraggy Pinnacle Mountainhad the most wonderful views.” Aline highly recommends taking a hike on one of the many trails in the Blue Ridge Mountains and if you have a sweet tooth  stopping atVortex Doughnuts. September and October are generally mild weather in Jackson Hole  allowing for plenty of time to be spent outdoors  which is exactly what you want to do when you’re here. There are beautiful mountains  and plenty of wildlife and you’re not far from the famousYellowstone National Park. Hannah (20  Germany) recommends entering Yellowstone from the South entrance on the Wyoming side. According to Hannah  “Jackson Hole and Yellowstone are places that you have to see with your own eyes. There are no words to describe this part of the United States.” Jackson Hole and Yellowstone are places that you have to see with your own eyes. There are no words to describe this part of the United States. Princeton is a small town in Central New Jersey that truly reaches peak beauty in the Autumn. There are a lot of preserved old-growth forests in this historic area  and trees that turn into radiant shades of red  yellow  and orange as we get deeper into fall. Add to this the historic beauty of the castle-like grounds ofPrinceton Universityand you’ll be in Instagram heaven. The town itself is a quaint collection of restaurants  cafes  and shops with lots to see and do during a day off. Be sure to let your Local Coordinator know if you plan to visit any of these recommended locations this fall and we always love to hear from you onInstagramorTikTok.Au Pair USAloves to learn about our au pairs’ adventures!Happy traveling!

The right host family may be bigger than you thought!,Every au pair has a vision of what their experience will be like in the U.S. Before theinterviewprocess begins  they might imagine their American host family to be like ones they’ve seen in the movies: a big house with a white picket fence  a dog  and one  or maybe two children. While youmayfind a family like that  it’s more likely that your host family will be different and unique. The families looking to host an au pair often have three or sometimes more kids. Sounds busy? It is…And that’s why they need an au pair! You might be intimidated by the idea of matching with a larger family  but we want to tell you some of the awesome benefits of being the au pair to a family with lots of kids. If you’re currently in the matching process  it’s important to remember to give all families a chance  not just the type you may have envisioned before joining the au pair program. Au Pair Raquel’s advice is  “Give the big family a chance. At least do the interview. You can always say no to the match.” When she was receiving interview requests  she didn’t think twice about meeting her current host family because of the kind and heartfelt note they sent to her. It’s not about finding that family you’ve been envisioning  it’s about finding the family that you connect with and feels right for you  whether they have one kid or five!

An Au Pair’s Colorful Footwear Experience,When Pablo  a 25-year-old Au Pair USA au pair from Spain  matched with his American host family  he expected the typical things anyone who decides to become an au pair would expect. As a participant of a cultural exchange program  he knew he would be helping his host family with childcare and teaching them about his culture  and they’d be helping him assimilate to life in the USA and perfect his use of spoken English. Pablo takes care of three school-aged boys and definitely does the basic au pair duties he imagined  like driving them to school and packing their lunches. But he also took on an exciting and unexpected role a few months ago when his oldest host kid  Ben (11) started coloring shoes. It all started when Ben got a new pair of shoes he didn’t love. Since he’s into art  he decided to decorate them and make them a little more fun and interesting. The colorful shoes turned out great and got lots of people’s attention. Ben started doing the same for other members of his family and some friends who liked the shoes he had painted. When Pablo saw how creative and talented Ben was  he also asked him to design a pair of shoes for him. It was soon suggested that Ben not only paint shoes as a hobby  but perhaps turn this creative outlet into a business. Pablo  a business school graduate whose favorite class had been marketing  stepped up to help Ben create a logo for his new business  anInstagram account  and advise him on hashtag and SEO strategy. And that’s whereB18Customsbegan. Pablo continues to support Ben in his entrepreneurial venture. He offers Ben tips on photographing his colorful shoes  advising him on the best lighting to use  experimenting with opportune times of day to snap the shots  and which backgrounds will look best. He even lets Ben take the photos using his phone  since he’s got a better camera at the moment. Ben has now taken on an investor (his mom) as his business and need for supplies grows. Ben expects he’ll be able to fulfill more orders over the summer when his school and baseball schedules are less demanding than they are now. Pablo  whose au pair year ends this August  has decided this will not be the end of his cultural exchange experience. He’s decided to extend his program  and while he’s had an incredible time with his current host family  he wants to check out other parts of the U.S. for his extension year. When asked what advice he’d give to new au pairs deciding to embark on this journey  he said  “You will learn more from your host kids than you actually teach them.” Even though Pablo has been an invaluable resource to Ben withB18Customs  Pablo feels like he got the better deal learning so much from his host family this past year.

Be attentive to your surroundings  especially in large crowds. And keep a safe distance from fireworks.

Ways to Celebrate Your Host Mom this Mother’s Day,Mother’s Day is will be here soon! This year it’s on Sunday  May 8th. You may not be able to celebrate with your own mom or grandma. However  this is a special opportunity to show your host mom just how much you care! Here are some simple ideas you can do as an au pair to show your host mom how much she is appreciated on this very important day: 1.Help the kids make breakfast. Consider waking up a little earlier than normal and helping the kids prepare breakfast for your host mom. Caroline  a Brazilian au pair in Washington  plans to make a special breakfast for her host mom this Mother’s Day. She’ll make a mix of Brazilian and American foods and present them to her host mom that morning with her twin toddlers she cares for. 2.Give a card. A small gesture like a thoughtful note or handmade card can go a long way. Telling your host mom how much you appreciate and admire her or just thanking her for the opportunity to be part of her family are sentiments that will surely warm her heart on Mother’s Day. 3.Get crafty. As a host mom to seven au pairs  I loved receiving homemade gifts from our au pairs on Mother’s Day. One year our au pair Karen  from Colombia  created a wall hanging decoration that spelled MOM in yarn and held memorable photos of my children. Caroline from Brazil is planning to draw family photos on a coffee cup and hat  two things her host mom will surely use regularly. 4.Be part of the family. Although you may not be formally scheduled to work on Mother’s Day  there’s nothing wrong with hanging out with your host mom and being a helpful family member. Small gestures allow your host mom to relax and enjoy the day. How will you be spending Mother’s Day this year? Let your local coordinator know on your next monthly check-in! Andif you haven’t joined our au pair community  but would like to  apply here. Your future host mom awaits! Maybe you’ll do some of these things next year to honor her on Mother’s Day.

Au Pair Celebrates her First Passover,When Alison  an au pair from Mexico  arrived on the program in 2021  she expected to learn about American culture and celebrate new holidays like the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving. She didn’t realize she’d be gaining an even deeper level of cultural understanding through her traditional and religious experiences with her host family. Alison grew up Catholic  and consequently celebrated holidays associated with the Christian faith. As an au pair for a Jewish host family  she has been fortunate to learn about both typical American family traditions and Jewish customs. This past month  Alison celebrated her very first Passover. Not knowing what to expect  Alison came to the table with an open mind and an understanding her expectations might be different than what she would experience. Her host mom explained in detail the preparation for the day  the menu items  and their significance from a biblical and historical standpoint. Alison looked over theSeder Plate  a traditional dish that presents seven items of food. There were interesting and new-to-her foods on display. She was especially apprehensive about the charoset. Typically served on Matzo  or unleavened bread  charoset is a dish made of chopped apples  walnuts  cinnamon and wine. Her host mom encouraged her to try it. Charoset quickly became her now favorite Passover food! In fact  Alison said she ate more of this than anyone else at dinner! Even though celebrating Passover was a totally new experience for Alison  she saw many similarities in how she and her family in Mexico celebrate holidays. For one  holidays are a great opportunity for family gatherings. You get to practice traditions and your beliefs bring you together. Even though Alison grew up with a different faith  she still felt included in her host family’s celebration. Another similarity? Food. Yes  the menus are quite different at Jewish American holiday versus Mexican ones. However  food remains the common denominator. Food makes people bond  no matter what the menu is composed of. Alison said being part of a family with different beliefs has been an unexpected blessing in her au pair experience. She would have never had the opportunity to learn about and celebrate a holiday like Passover had she stayed in her home country and her comfort zone. “Overall  it was something unique that I’ve never done before ” Alison said. “I’m so glad I had this experience and learned to do something different.” Back in Mexico  Alison would have celebrated Easter differently  teaching others about the Christian faith at Catholic mass. This year shebecame the student. Alison learned about a new faith  culture  and family traditions by celebrating Passover with her American host family.

British Au Pairs Reflect on Their Time in the U.S.,Choosing to become an au pair is certainly a big decision! You might be wondering if a year is too long a time to be away from home or if living with an American family is the right environment for you. When you’re at a crossroads to decide  it can be helpful to hear from others who have been in your shoes before. Check out what Natalie and Mollie  two British au pairs who recently completed their au pair program  have to say! I originally applied to become an au pair with the hope of exploring a different style of childcare. I’d only ever worked within a preschool/nursery setting at home  and I wanted to experience a different approach to working with children. I also loved the idea of being able to explore new places and meet new people while doing so. I thoroughly enjoyed meeting new people in the USA  experiencing new ways of life and exploring many amazing places around where I was located in California: San Diego  Los Angeles  Palm Springs  Big Bear  Lake Tahoe and many others. Visiting Palm Springs was without a doubt my favorite part of my whole experience. This is something I never would have been able to do  had I not taken part in Au Pair USA. I learned many things during my time in the USA. This experience helped me grow as a person  gain confidence within myself and allowed my independent nature to shine through. After I came back to the UK I was able to apply and become a Deputy Manager within a Preschool setting! My plan for the future is to continue to advance my childcare career as well as travel and see the world. Being an au pair has really inspired me to see more of the world and to progress in my career. My advice for new au pairs would be to go for it. It is scary and it may be the biggest thing you ever do  however  in my experience it will be the best thing you ever do too! Always go with your gut when it comes to choosing a family to match with  as finding the right family for you will make all the difference to your experience. The other thing I would say is  don’t be afraid to do this on your own. You definitely won’t feel alone while you’re out there. Enjoy every moment and if you’re missing home or feeling unsure  keep pushing through because it is worth it in the end. My time as an au pair in the USA was incredible and I wouldn’t change a thing about it. When I applied to be an au pair  I was at college studying childcare. I was working part time in a day nursery and part time in a milkshake place!I went along to a presentation about Au Pair USA. I decided to apply because I could see it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I was soon to finish college and thought  what better way to start my career!Soon after I graduated from college  I matched with a family in Chicago who had just had a baby.The thing I enjoyed the most was learning about the different way of life of a family in the USA compared to my life in the UK. I really enjoyed just being in a different country  being independent and meeting new friends. I think I found that getting to know new people was the key to everything. I enjoyed the studying I got to do as part of the program. It really enabled me to make new friends too. I used to go out for dinner with my friends regularly and we did things like bus tours around the city  getting to know Chicago. I think I adapted quite quickly to my new life as an au pair in Chicago. My host family were first time parents  so I found that I was able to teach them what I knew about childcare from my course and experience at the nursery. My advice to new au pairs would be to be open-minded and take everything as it comes. It will all work out in the end  even if it’s hard to settle in at first. I found that keeping in touch with my own family back home regularly really helped and making friends locally was a big benefit. Your host family will do their best to make you feel at home. Everyone adapts and learns from each other. I would 100% recommend Au Pair USA to anyone thinking of becoming an au pair! I’d love to be able to do it again. My heart will always be in working with children. British au pairs are just one part of the multicultural family that make the Au Pair USA community so strong; au pairs from all over the world have rewarding experiences sharing their culture with U.S. host families. Starthere to learn more and apply to become an au pair with Au Pair USA. We’ve been successfully matching au pairs with American host families for over 30 years and would love for you to join in on the amazing experiences Natalie  Mollie and thousands of other au pairs have had!

What does it take to be a Super Au Pair?,When Lavinia “Lavi” of Curitiba  Brazil was applying to become an au pair last year  she came acrossthis blog postabout the 2020 Super Au Pair  Maureen from Germany. Lavi was impressed and never imagined one day in the not-so-distant future that she would be crowned this year’s Super Au Pair! Having arrived just months before she earned herSuperstatus  Lavi has plenty of advice for au pairs striving to be super! First and foremost  she thinks of the kids first in everything she does. How can she make things fun for them? They love doing arts and crafts  cooking together  playing outdoors  exploring in nature and building couch cushion forts on rainy days. Her creativity never stops when trying to keep playtime exciting and entertaining for her 18-month-old  three-year-old and eight-year-old alike. To be a Super Au Pair  the relationship building can’t stop with your host kids  though. Having open communication and a strong connection with your host parents is equally as important. Since Lavi’s host father was deployed in Africa with the U.S. military for the first few months of her program year  her host mom relied on her for support. Lavi stepped right up! She was totally willing to be a helpful family member  but also be a friend to her host mom. Lavi says she tries to be extremely flexible to accommodate her host mom’s unpredictable work schedule as a midwife. Her host mom shows her the same consideration by taking Lavi on local adventures and ensuring Lavi has time to socialize with friends. Even though there was an instant connection felt during the interview process  Lavi and her host mom have still become much closer since Lavi’s arrival: they bond over both their affinity for organizing things around the house and their love of watching tv shows like “The Bachelor”. Being a Super Au Pair is great but that doesn’t mean there aren’t hard days too. Lavi says that on challenging days she tries her best to focus on the positive. She makes sure that she makes time for the things she loves  like going for walks and getting fresh air. She says being in nature always recharges her. The best part about finding out she had won the Super Au Pair contest?She learned about it while meeting her host dad in person for the first time!He arrived at home with balloons  which confused Lavi at first. She thought  “why is he bringingmeballoons?Heshould be the one receiving balloons after arriving home after one year.” Little did she know those balloons were for her and the celebration was a joint one: Host Dad’s arrival and Lavi’s newly earned Super Au Pair title!

Spring has Sprung,Spring is here! Whether you live in a place where you’re starting to see flowers bloom and temperatures rise or you’ve just got spring fever and can’t wait for it to happen  spring is in the air! Between upcoming spring break plans  spring sports seasons  and planning any summer trips  there’s a lot to think about as an au pair. Here are some spring tips to get you ready for the upcoming season: Most school-aged kids will get a week off of school during the spring season  known as spring break. Some families may need to work  which means you’ll likely be watching the kids all day and may need to plan for some fun  spring activities. Others may choose to travel during this time. Be sure to ask your host family if you’ll be traveling with them and are expected to work during that time or if you’ll have the week off and be able to schedule some of your own vacation time. Either way  be prepared for your typical routine to be sprung around a bit. Even if the temperature still feels like winter where you are  if your host kids are registered for spring sports  you may find yourself out on the baseball or softball field some afternoons. Be sure to dress you and your kids for the weather (layers are always a good idea if it’s chilly as the kids may get warm while they exercise)  pack plenty of water and snacks and any equipment they may need for their particular sports. It’s not too early to start planning some trips this summer. Talk to your Host Family about their plans and then discuss when you can do some exploring of your own. You can also talk to other au pairs and friends to see if they want to plan a trip together.  If you are planning to travel on your own  read oursolo travel tipsto maximize your funandsafety! Spring is a great time for new beginnings and a fresh start. Why not do a little spring cleaning and organize your things? Take a look at who just arrived in your area and make a new au pair friend or two. Decide to visit someplace new that you weren’t planning to. Take advantage of this beautiful change in season during your au pair year in the U.S.!

Three Essential Tips for Solo Female Traveling,Traveling is one of life’s most rewarding experiences. It can be challenging  however – especially if you identify as a woman. Fortunately  InterExchange is full of women who can offer advice. Lindsay Sainz and Machada Smith-McGovern have a few tips on the topic of traveling safely as a woman. For Machada  the most important element when traveling solo is to be prepared and to take time to plan trips ahead of time. “Choosing a destination with intention is important  but I always check theState Department’s Travel Advisories List before traveling internationally.” She also recommends packing light: “be sure to bring the necessities (passport  cash  maps  supplies  etc.) and keep them safe!” Lindsay agrees: “I don’t wear expensive clothing or jewelry while traveling because I don’t want to draw any unwanted attention.” Similarly  she plans her trips to get by on a daily basis without carrying much money on her  and doesn’t keep all of her money in the same place when traveling. “I may leave some in a safe in my room  some in my purse and some in my front pocket. I also don’t carry my passport with me unless I absolutely need it. Be careful with backpacks because people can unzip and steal things without you noticing.” On that note  Lindsay recommends choosing a hotel in a safe  populated area. “Ask your hotel for tips and advice when you get there. You can also research free walking tours when you visit a new city. It’s a good way to meet fellow travelers ” says Lindsay  “so you can make plans together if you don’t feel comfortable going to certain places alone. You can also ask the tour guide for advice on areas to explore or avoid.” There are plenty of tools available for you to plan your trips in advance! You can: Language barriers are one of the biggest challenges of traveling safely as a woman in another country  alone or not. “One challenge I think everyone can relate to is the language barrier ” says Lindsay. “This is one you can prepare for a bit bydownloading offline Google Translate taking an online language course  and writing down some key words and phrases before your trip.” (Here is agreat list of phrases to consider learning before you go to another country.) Finally  Lindsay observes that “directions can be a challenge and I have gotten lost quite a few times. If I know I won’t have easy access to the Internet  I will download offline maps and mark all of the destinations I am interested in  as well as my hotel.” Machada has a personal story about trying to overcome language barriers  and what she learned from a frustrating experience: When I was 21  I traveled from Beijing to Yunnan Province alone  by train and bus. This three-day journey was difficult to say the least! It was the ultimate test of my Chinese language skills after the end of my study abroad year. I missed one connection bus three times because I was having difficulty understanding the dialect in Wuhan. I went to the wrong bus depot (there were four in the city.) This was also before smartphones  so I had to use an actual dictionary to translate the scribbled down directions I had been given by a very old taxi driver. I’ll always remember the feeling when I finally found the correct bus! Two days later  after two more train rides and countless conversations with interesting strangers along the way  I finally made it to beautiful Xishuangbanna in Yunnan. To overcome a challenge  I always try to find the humor and keep going and trust that I’ll get there– eventually! Alright  so you’ve planned ahead and practiced the local language. You’re ready to dive into your trip. But how will you spend your days? Machada recommends traveling like a local “Try to support the local economy ” she says. “Buy from local artisans  eating local food  and staying in locally-owned accommodations.” To create the strongest memories on your trip  Lindsay recommends making new friends as often as possible: Most other solo female travelers understand the importance of traveling in groups and will likely welcome the chance to hang out with you. It’s also a good opportunity to see where they have traveled and exchange any advice.” But one shouldn’t be too trusting. You can stay safer by projecting confidence. “I like to appear as though I am confident when walking in the streets  instead of looking like I’m lost (even if Iamlost) ” says Lindsay. “If you need to ask for directions  it’s a good idea to ask a shop owner or someone working in the area.” Similarly  “when in a taxi  pay close attention to where you are driving and try to follow along on Google Maps or a downloaded offline map to make sure the driver is taking you where you want to go.” Sometimes things might seem off; trust your judgment and stay calm! Lindsay was once approached by a man at a restaurant while having tea. “We had a polite conversation and then I decided to go back to my hotel. He followed me and would not accept that I did not want him to escort me to my hotel (I did not want him to know where I was staying). “Instead I gave him my phone number and insisted that we could meet up later  even though I had no intention of doing so. It was the only thing I could think of to get him to leave me alone. I had this conversation with him on a busy street and refused to walk toward my hotel until he had already left and I was confident that he was no longer watching.” You can find similaranecdotes on staying safe while traveling in this greatNew York Timesarticle!

InterExchange Statement on Ukraine,For many years  young people from Ukraine and Russia have come to the United States on BridgeUSA programs sponsored by InterExchange. Through person to person exchanges  these young people helped advance the vision of theFulbright Hays Act of 1961by building enduring bridges of friendship between people and nations. The events unfolding in Ukraine do not represent the world that young people want or deserve. Instead  they stand in sharp contrast to the goals of mutual understanding and peaceful relations that exchange programs seek to accomplish. Our thoughts are for the safety and wellbeing of our alumni  the families and loved ones of our current participants  and the many people who have worked on behalf of these important programs around the world. May there be a swift end to the aggression  and an immediate return to peace and mutual understanding.

Celebrating Valentine’s Day in the U.S.A.,Valentine’s Day is just around the corner on February 14th. While this may be known as the Day of Love  it’s certainly not limited to romantic relationships here in the U.S. Whether you’re single  in a long-distance relationship  or have a partner here in the States  there are many ways you can expect to celebrate valentine’s day as an au pair: 1.Get crafty!If your host child goes to school  you’ll likely be making Valentine cards for each student in their class. If you’re a DIYer (you like to “Do It Yourself”)  you can use supplies like red  pink and white construction paper  stickers  lace doilies  and ink stamps. Most of these supplies can be found at a dollar store. This is a great way to get creative with your kids  practice writing and cutting skills  and spend quality time together. Don’t worry if this sounds intimidating to you or you take care of three kids each in classes of 30! You can also buy pre-made Valentines where you just need to add names. And if you’re taking care of a baby  toddler or homeschooler  try doing a simple form of this activity so they can present Valentine’s cards to their parents. 2. Eat some chocolate!It’s common to give and receive chocolate on Valentine’s Day here in the U.S. The heart shaped box filled with different kinds of chocolates inside is the standard gift. You can also give treats like this to your host children  friends  or even your Local Coordinator. Who doesn’t love some sweet treats! Just be sure to check the label if your host kids have allergies. Many Valentine’s Day chocolates contain nuts! 3.Celebrate with friends!It isn’t necessary to celebrate Valentine’s Day with a romantic partner. Many women celebrate “Galentine’s Day” on Valentine’s Day  where they get together with girlfriends and just have a good time. Some ideas could be having a potluck dinner  dressing up and going out to dinner  or having a good  old fashioned slumber party watching movies and eating pizza. Side note: you might be working on Valentine’s Day evening if your host parents are planning to enjoy a date night to celebrate. That’s ok! You can always celebrate “Galentine’s Day” the following weekend! 4.Wear V-day colors!Traditionally  red and pink are colors you’ll see on Valentine’s Day decorations  but it doesn’t stop there. Your host children might wear these colors to school that day. Why not join in on the fun and do the same? Get in the spirit by wearing a red or pink shirt or pants on this day. Being an au pair means embracing all the cultural differences present in your host country. Even if you’re used to celebrating Valentine’s Day in a totally different way  be sure to try something new this year! Eat heart-shaped pizza. Wear your favorite pink shirt. Create Valentine cards for your besties. This year is all about cultural exchange and Valentine’s Day is a great way to LOVE the experience in this way. If you’re ready to celebrate holidays like Valentine’s Day in the U.S. as an au pair  get started by applyinghere. Marisa is a lover of all things cultural exchange.

Boots and BBQ: What’s Hot in Texas,Is “everything bigger in Texas”? That’s one common saying associated with the Southern U.S. state. While it may notliterallybe true  one can say that Texas has its own distinct personality – one of the largest personalities of any state in the country. This makes it a must-see state in which to experience U.S. culture! Read on to learn why you should consider Texas for its diversity of culture  food  and city vibes mixed with beautiful nature. Texas is referred to as the “Lone Star State” because of its flag  which symbolizes independence from Mexico in 1836. Independence is a trait many people in the U.S. identify with  and many Texans are particularly proud of this heritage. The concept of independence  and the state of Texas  are also both associated with cowboys. Texas is full of cowboy imagery. Historically  a “cowboy” was a job: men on horses would guide cattle in particular directions. The Texas Historical Commissionnotesthat: Cattle drives in Texas originated about 300 years ago… Herds of cattle roamed with abandon in the wilds of Texas and were driven northward by cowboys to railroads where the beef was sent to populated cities in the U.S. Many Texas songs reference cowboys. This is particularly true of American “country” music  often associated with Texas but also popular across many other regions in the U.S. The host family of Mexican au pair Ana loves country music and playing guitar. “I am learning from their favorite artists and musicians ” she said. In addition to music  cowboy hats  boots  and belt buckles are commonly worn with pride  throughout the state. (Planning a shopping trip? TheHouston Chroniclecan recommend a few places to buy cowboy boots in Texas. Be warned  though  that cowboy boots can take quite some time to break in.) One of the state’s American football teams  based in Dallas  is evencalledthe Cowboys. Former U.S. President (and Texas governor) George W. Bush was often pictured in a cowboy hat and boots when not in the White House. And what do cowboys do? Traditionally  they herd cattle. So it’s no surprise that beef is a key part of Texan cuisine. Texans like steaks and barbecued meat. The latter  usually shortened to “BBQ ” is found in many U.S. states  but uniquely prepared in Texas and a must-try experience when you visit. According toEncyclopedia Britannica: Texas barbecue has a number of influences  including the meat-smoking techniques of 19th-century immigrants from Germany and Czechoslovakia who settled in the central part of the state… Barbecued beef brisket starts as a tough cut of meat from the breast or chest of a cow. It is then rubbed with salt and coarse pepper (occasionally with cayenne and garlic as well) and slowly smoked  traditionally over oak in central Texas but sometimes over charcoal… Brisket is also used in another Texas dish  the BBQ beef sandwich  in which the “burnt ends” of the meat are chopped  slathered with a sweet or spicy sauce  topped with onions  and served on a bun. Because of Texas’s history with—and closeness to—Mexico  that country has influenced Texas cuisine as well! Tex-Mex is a blend of the two cultures’ foods that can be found all over the state characterized by “heavy use of shredded cheese  beans  meat (particularly chicken  beef  and pork)  peppers  and spices  in addition to flour tortillas.” Steak and Tex-Mex aren’t the only cuisine you’ll find in Texas. Curious what else there is? TheFood Network prepared this list of traditionally Texan cuisineand theDallas Morning Newshas some advice on where in the state to find them. (Both complete with pictures; don’t click on an empty stomach 😋) Even the little differences are noticeable to au pairs:Ana notes that her host kids’ “breakfast basics are bacon  pancakes  and eggs.” Large meals may be an American stereotype  but the sheer size of this one makes it “a very Texan breakfast.” Austin is a city currently in the middle of major growth. What was formerly a mid-sized city is sprawling  fueled in part by corporations such as Tesla and Samsung. But there’s more to see in Austin than just another U.S. city; there’s a strong “alternative” vibe here  supported by large  well-known (especially on social media!) festivals such asSouth by SouthwestandAustin City Limits Music Festival. There are plenty of outdoor activities in Austin as well! If you want to see the city quickly and intimately  consider one of theseveraltypesof scooters orbikesavailable for rent around the city! If you’re looking for something a bit more exerting  consider a hike upMount Bonnell! Afterwards  cool off in a nearby lake  such asLake TravisorLake Austin  with ajet ski!See thisYelp list for other outdoor fun! There is also a growing area of retail stores with modern  stylish surroundings that stretch along South Congress Avenue outside of the central business district if you’re feeling like shopping or want to explore some unique dining experiences or grab a coffee. Speaking of food: in Austin  that’s worth your time as well! There is  of course  BBQ  such asTerry Black’s BBQ  and also other delicious treats  likeJeni’s Ice Cream! Beyoncé’s hometown of Houston is Texas’s fourth-largest city  and au pairs have taken notice. “It’s a very big city ” says Ana  “with a huge freeway that at first I was scared to drive on.” But she got used to it: “Now I enjoy it so much. I love to see the skyline especially at night.” Ana recommends going to theHouston Zoo– particularly to see the lights at night – hang outdowntown  and visitNASA’s “Space Center Houston.” Houston has its own football team as well: theHouston Texans! Au Pair USA Local Coordinator Caroline  a Texas native  also has some recommendations for Houston: The separate Texas cities of Dallas and Fort Worth are so close together that they’re often referred to as “Dallas–Fort Worth ” or “DFW.” There’s plenty to love in DFW: San Antonio  the closest big city to the U.S. border  wowed Ana. “It reminded me of my beloved Mexico ” she said. It’s got a strong sense of colonial history and Mexican heritage… … in addition to more modern things  such as very-Instagrammable rooftop pools: Caroline has a few of her own San Antonio recommendations: So  is everything bigger in Texas? Maybe not. But  as an au pair  you’ll have an enormous amount of opportunity to exchange culture in the Lone Star State. Because of the blend of Mexican and American culture  you’ll easily be able to use – or learn and practice – the Spanish language. This blend is one contributor to the state’s increasing diversity:theTexas Tribunenotes that “people of color currently make up 95% of Texas’ population growth ”and that this growth extends to both suburbs and cities. There are many great states in the USA  and this blog is part of a series that we hope will help you find out more about where you might like to au pair when considering the U.S. (The first in the series is all aboutwhy you should consider being an au pair in New Jersey).

Achieving Your New Year’s Resolutions,The new year always motivates people to make big promises to themselves. What about you? Have you made new year’s resolutions about getting healthier? Creating lasting memories in the USA or advancing your English language skills? Something else? Well  one common factor will help you achieve any and all of these goals: being intentional. Deciding how you will spend your time  prioritizing your schedule  and putting forth your effort are the ingredients for a simple recipe for success when achieving your new year’s resolutions. Of course  there are some additional tips to make the job that much easier. Still  intentionality is the foundation of it all. Here are some examples of how being intentional is a foolproof way to achieve any goal in life: Images courtesy of Dham. Earlier  I mentioned tips to make it happen  and I want to name a few. Beingspecificabout your goals is crucial. For example  don’t just say you want to get healthier in 2022. Say you want to exercise three times a week and then schedule the time to exercise on each of those days. Also  don’t expect to make big changes all at once. Try sticking to a resolution for a month  or even a week. Taking small steps and creating habits allows for a more sustainable journey and positive results. Lastly  having a support system makes your goal achievement that much easier. For example  choosing to get healthier with a friend is a great way to have an accountability buddy and motivation on days you may not feel like working out. You can even let your host family know about your resolutions so they can cheer you on as you accomplish them. If one of your2022 goals is to become an au pair  start here. Au Pair USA has successfully matched au pairs and host families for over 30 years. We look forward to being part of your 2022 goals! Marisa is a lover of all things cultural exchange.

Embracing New Cultures and Traditions,When au pair Jimena from Mexico matched with her host family  she thought the cultural differences might be a difficult adjustment. Not only was her host family American  they were also originally from India  so she wasn’t sure what to expect. Would they celebrate Christmas? Or Día de los Muertos? Would she like the food? Would it be too spicy? Jimena asked herself a question common to many new au pairs: will differences in holiday cultures and traditions with your host family be difficult? And she was pleased to learn that the answer was no! Since her arrival ago  Jimena and her host family have both embraced each other’s cultural traditions. They have even noticed how  despite many differences  there are also important similarities. For example  both Indian and Mexican cuisine tend to be spicy by American standards. However  Jimena says  “the first time I tried Indian food  it was like an explosion of flavors in my mouth. So different  but I really liked it!” This past Autumn  Jimena had her first chance to celebrate Diwali  the festival of lights  with her host family. She wore traditional Indian clothes and listened to Indian prayers and offerings. She also learned the stories behind the holiday and ate delicious Indian food with her extended host family. They even set off fireworks in honor of the festival of lights. Jimena was only used to doing this on Mexico’s Independence Day! Jimena’s favorite part of this day  however  was the similarity she saw of her host family gathering together with extended family and friends celebrating the day in unison. This is similar to how she and her family celebrate Christmas each year in Mexico. There weren’t any tamales or pozole (a traditional Mexican soup eaten during the holiday season). Nevertheless  Jimena loved trying all the delicious Indian delicacies  especially dosa  which she thought was similar to a crunchy tortilla. Jimena has grown to love the new culture and traditions she is experiencing as an au pair living in the U.S. with an American host family of Indian heritage. Even on her days off  you can find Jimena eating at Indian restaurants  introducing au pair friends to tasty Indian dishes. Her biggest lesson since the start of her cultural exchange experience has been that despite many cultural differences she and her host family have  the importance placed on family is the same. She feels grateful to learn about Indian culture through her host family and will be forever changed as a person after her year as an au pair. And one of the most rewarding parts about being an au pair is that learning about cultures goes both ways: host families are also eager to learn about their au pairs’ cultures as well!

Au Pairs Volunteer at the TCS NYC Marathon,Au pairs come to the United States  for a variety of reasons: learning about U.S. culture  making an impact on the communities in which they live  and making memories they’ll remember forever. Over the course of their program year in the USA  au pairs hopefully achieve each of these goals. However  a few au pairs were able to do all three in a single day  by volunteering at the 2021 New York City Marathon. Pushing one’s body to run 26.2 miles (42.2 kilometers) – the length of a marathon – may seem like the most punishing sport imaginable. While none of the au pairs were runners themselves  many are interested in learning more about sports as they relate to U.S. culture. “There’s so much I don’t understand about sports in the USA ” says au pair Taís  from Brazil. “But I enjoy learning!” With this same love of learning  about a dozen au pairs gathered at the 2021 TCS New York City Marathon on the chilly morning of November 7  2021. They joined a group of volunteers from many other countries at the 18th mile (or 28th kilometer) of the marathon. Many regard this stretch of the race as the most difficult  as it’s so close to the finish  yet a significant amount of distance remains. Because of this  runners often need a boost at this point. The volunteers at the Mile 18 marker were there to pass out cups of water and Gatorade. Alejandra  from Mexico  was amazed at the runners’ determination: “often they just grabbed the cups without slowing down ” she said. Local Coordinator Nancy also inspired the au pairs to shout words of encouragement as racers ran past. “I did a marathon in the past ” she said. “So I know how much the runners need support at this stage of the race!” This energy was crucial for Alejandra: “I didn’t think I was going to make it because I had to travel from Philadelphia to NYC and I was tired. But as soon as I got into the volunteering station and started to meet new au pairs and feel the energy of the people and  of course  the runners  my whole mood changed. It was really pleasant to support the runners. I particularly enjoyed looking at the people who were running for a reason  like their first marathon or in honor of some family member.” What did au pairs learn by the end of the day? “I feel like I learned more about Americans’ love of sports ” said Estrella  from the Netherlands. Alejandra felt a personal connection at the end of the day volunteering: “For me  the runners’ race reminds me of my own journey in order to become an au pair in the United States and I’ve enjoyed every single minute on this path.. Running is just one of many athletic activities that au pairs encounter during their time in the USA. Americans love a variety of sports  and we’ve found that au pairs learn a lot about U.S. culture by attending a game or match.

Au Pairs Explore Sights Across the USA,Traveling in the USA is one of the many benefits to becoming an au pair. And lots of our au pairs are venturing beyond their local areas to explore some exciting destinations on host family trips and in their own free time. Monica  from Mexico  had never been to the U.S. before joining the Au Pair Program. She has now visited several states  and was amazed at her unique experiences in each one. Based in New York City  she travelled with other au pairs to Boston and Arizona  which were both on her wish list  as well as California and Nevada. “The travel was even better than I expected ” she said. “It’s hard to pick one favorite trip — every place showed me its own charming vibe.” Perhaps if she had to choose her best travel experience  it would be spending Halloween in Salem  Massachusetts — one of the oldest cities in the U.S.  famous for its 1692 witch trials and historical houses. And where is next? Monica is a huge Disney fan and is thrilled to be going to Orlando  Florida in her two weeks of vacation  and will also take a trip with her host family. Irina  from Spain  had only been to the United States once  to New York with her mom  before becoming an au pair. In her first three months  she has visited Michigan  and her dream destination Colorado  with her host family. A keen traveller  she loves exploring the great outdoors with her hosts  and together they spent one month in Colorado’s Steamboat Springs. They hiked in mountains that Irina found “breathtaking” and she went paddle boarding for the first time with the kids. Another highlight was spotting a moose with her baby! Irina also learned about alpine wildflowers with the family. “Every time we went hiking we took pictures of the flowers and then we checked their name in a book and wrote down the day and the place we saw them ” she said. Irina is keen to see more of the US — before leaving  her aim is to visit as many cities and states as she can. Washington State is another ‘must-see’ destination  so she has already booked a trip to Seattle. The vastness of the USA is also appealing to Andrea  from Mexico  who took a road trip with another au pair. They stopped at Connecticut  North Hampshire  Rhode Island  Maine  Massachusetts  Vermont and New York. “We got to see many places and small towns that we hadn’t planned to visit ” she says. But perhaps her most unforgettable trip was to Fairbanks  Alaska. She saw the Northern Lights and bathed in hot springs  when the sub-zero temperatures meant that her hair froze! “I had never thought I would be there one day  so I felt so happy and grateful ” she said. “It was an experience that I would like everyone to have.” “I had never thought I would be there one day  so I felt so happy and grateful ” Andrea’s hosts also gave her the opportunity to try skiing for the first time  and other fun outdoor activities. The family has traveled to winter destinations Buffalo  New York State  and Horseshoe  West Virginia. They also visited the Outer Banks of North Carolina  known for its tranquil beaches and water sports. As well as her love of nature  Andrea also enjoys visiting monuments  art museums and the locations that she’s seen in the movies! At the end of the program  she’s planning to go on a second road trip  visiting the West Coast and to see a Broadway Musical in New York. With possibilities of host family trips  two weeks of paid time off  and a 30-day travel period at the end of the program  au pairs are finding that they have fantastic opportunities for travel (amongother benefits😊 ) in the United States. And some au pairs take a completely different approach to traveling in the USA: read how au pairs have takenfun and rewarding shorter trips  closer to home. Editor and Teacher.

Au Pairs Learn the Cultural Importance of Sports,2021 was a great year for sports! This summer  we’ve seen football (or “soccer” 😂 ) tournaments in Europe and Latin America  and now the Olympics! After a difficult 2020  athletes are returning to fields around the world. Of course  sports entertain and promote exercise. They also facilitate something about which we’re passionate: cultural exchange. Au pairs have found that sporting events in the USA allow them to make new friends  learn about U.S. culture  and share parts of their own culture. Read on to learn about the cultural importance of sports! While Calvin and Rocio spread their love of soccer to Americans  a few au pairs have found their appreciation for baseball. Taís  a Brazilian living with a Maryland host family  recently saw a game between two local teams. Even though it wasn’t a big game  Taís loved it. “I’m still trying to understand the whole thing ” she admits. “But I’ll get there!” Au pair Lara  from South Africa  saw aslightlymore famous baseball team play. Okay  she saw the world’smostfamous team: the New York Yankees. Lara currently living in the neighboring state of New Jersey  traveled to Yankee Stadium in New York. Although her favorite player (Derek Jeter) retired from the game years ago  Lara had a great time. “It was such an amazing experience ” she says. “I would definitely recommend a baseball game to every other au pair out there!” Another particularly interesting sport to many J-1 Exchange Visitors isAmericanfootball  which – seen in person – can be a rowdy and thrilling experience! Don’t know how to play? No worries! Check outthis explanation of American football  along witha guide to its biggest game  written by a former J-1 participant! Sure  sports bring people together and help teach about culture. But they’re also much more important than that! The Council of Europe has observed that “sports can reduce racism and be an important tool of diplomacy.” Similarly  the United Nations has noted that “sports can be a diplomatic bridge to peace and a vehicle for healing political and cultural rifts among communities.” As the isolation caused by COVID-19 comes to a close  the world needs all the help it can get to bring communities back together. We’ll be watching the Olympics with the hope that sports can help this happen! Are you looking for an opportunity to see a sporting event in America?

Why You Should Au Pair in New Jersey,When you think of an American state with sunny beaches  beautiful ocean views  and lots of families enjoying fun amusement rides  you probably think of California. But all the way on the other side of America is another summertime beach destination that also happens to be close to the great cities of New York City and Philadelphia. We’re going to let you in on a little secret  New Jersey is one of the most popular destinations for au pairs. In fact  despite its small size  New Jersey hosts the second highest number of au pairs per capita of any U.S. state. There are many reasons you should consider being an au pair in New Jersey  also known as theGarden State. You’ll find plenty of Instagram-worthy outdoor adventures in New Jersey  which is also known as the “Garden State” because of its beautiful nature. Let’s start with the Jersey Shore! You may have heard about the old reality TV show of the same name  but there’s more to it than that! The Jersey Shore is long; it consists of about 141 miles (or 226 kilometers) of beach along the Atlantic Ocean. Because it’s so long  there are many towns and areas  each offering their own experiences! Au pair Lara loved Wildwood  a beach city on the southern end of the coast. “I went parasailing on the beach ” says Lara  “Rode in a Ferris wheel  and had a delicious açaí bowl on the boardwalk. I went last year for the last weekend of summer; it was a great way to end the season!” Other great locations on the Shore include Atlantic City  or “AC.” Because of its many themed casinos  it’s often compared to Las Vegas  but AC offers more than gambling! You can spend an afternoon wandering its own beachside boardwalk! Travel far enough west  and you’ll start to see more rugged terrain. Lara recently took a hiking trip to Delaware Water Gap with fellow South Africans. “The view was amazing ” she says. “We even saw a snake!” As an au pair  there will be times when you want to – using an American expression – “let off some steam” and relax. New Jersey has two great options for this: theme parks and discount shopping.Six Flags Great Adventure  in mid-Jersey  is one of the region’s biggest theme parks. (Although that certainly isn’t the only one!) And of course  au pairs love themany shopping malls in the state. (Another Western expression: “retail therapy”; shopping can heal many emotional wounds!) Lara recommendsMenlo Park Mallin Edison Short Hills Mallin Essex County  andLivingston Mallin (you guessed it 😂) Livingston. Finally  if you’re looking to combine your shopping experience with a theme park adventure  you have to check outAmerican Dreamin East Rutherford. Every year  thousands of au pairs come to the USA to participate in cultural exchange and to practice their English. You’ll find plenty of opportunities for both in New Jersey! Au Pair USA’s James Song  a New Jersey native  notes that “the state is incredibly diverse. I grew up in a very multicultural area with a heavy Italian-American influence but also Korean  Hispanic  Black  Greek  Turkish  Indian  etc. It was a crash course on multiculturalism!” James noted that practicing other languages came easily in the state: “I met friends’ grandparents who only spoke Sicilian Italian  we quickly picked up basic Spanish  and I spoke Korean with my fellow Korean classmates.” South African au pair Juan Marie discovered this was true. She arrived in the USA to find herself in… Italy? Juan Marie was delighted to learn about the Italian-American heritage in her new state of New Jersey. Part of what contributes to the state’s cultural diversity is how easy it is to get around. One of the great things about New Jersey is the access to many public transportation options.Amtrakis a great way to visit the states near Jersey  and also to take longer cross-country trips!New Jersey TransitandPATHare options for shorter travel; you can take advantage of them when taking day trips in and around the state. We mentioned above how close New Jersey is to New York. In fact  New York City is right across the river from North Jersey  and Philadelphia is a quick trip from the western parts of the state. Being an au pair in the USA wouldn’t be complete without a trip to both cities. We’ve all seen the glitz and glamour of NYC on our social media feeds. But au pair Alejandra from Mexico  currently based in the Philadelphia area  loves her new community for its culture and art spaces. Alejandra has a bit of advice that’s applicable as a future au pair considering where to live: “My favorite part of being an au pair ” she says  “is the opportunity to explore a new city as a local!” Want to read more about local travel advice?

Au Pairs Explore the Sights Closer to Home,Over the past year  the opportunities to travel far have been limited. This new reality could have been especially disheartening to au pairs hoping to explore this huge country  but these limitations couldn’t didn’t stop our au pairs them. from exploring parts of America closer to their new homes. Instead of traveling great distances  they au pairs found interesting places closer to home and explored these local areas more deeply. When they couldn’t travel with others  they traveled solo. And they took advantage of opportunities to spend more time with their host families. Mountains were central to au pair Rita’s lockdown traveling experience. When she joined a California host family near Yosemite National Park  Rita – from Portugal – was excited to visit the park at some point during her stay. “I was so eager to go ” says Rita  “that I traveled during the chilly weather of the fall season. I had a week off and none of my friends were available to go  so I decided to go by myself. Yosemite was a priority on my travel list.” “I was a bit nervous though ” she admits  “because it was the first time I was doing a solo trip.” But she found that the trip made her grow as a person  “Being alone made me trust myself and plan more. I am very distracted and I always lose things like the car keys  and knowing that I was the only one I could count on made me more aware of my surroundings and my things.” Yosemite wasn’t the only trip Rita took. “I love to drive around California. Driving alongside agricultural fields made me realize how much farming goes on in California. I also drove up to San Francisco  where I visited the different neighborhoods and learned about the incredible multicultural diversity that the city is built on. I also drove through Big Sur  where the view was stunning. It was one of the best experiences of my life. Through the trip  I learned about U.S. culture. One of the things I learned is that Americans value being outside.” In contrast to Rita  Mexican au pair Dham was at first pessimistic that she’d be able to travel at all during the pandemic. However  her Philadelphia host family was very accommodating of her desire to travel. “They introduced me to the culture and cities around Philadelphia. We went to New York  New Jersey  and Washington.” says Dham. “We travel safely – with masks and sanitizer gel ” she adds. Au pair Lucas  from Brazil  also spent time during the pandemic traveling closer to home with his Baltimore based host family. “We went to Pocono Pines in Pennsylvania for 3 days. It was really cool and exciting  because we did a lot of activities that I had never done before  not to mention that they always gave me the freedom to do what I wanted. The trip made us stay closer than we would have been!” Like Rita  Lucas’s trip also taught him about American culture: “It’s totally different from Brazil’s ” he says. “In the beginning  the differences were really shocking  but now I’m getting used to it.” Traveling with his host family helped him speed this process along. Washington state au pair Rocío explored areasveryclose to her new home  traveling around the Seattle area. She now knows the city like a tourist guide  and can recommend that visitors see locations such as theSpace Needle  the “gum wall ” and the localFarmers Market. The travel limitations of the pandemic taught Rocío  from Costa Rica  that one can have fun in the simplest ways. “I spent a day at the University of Washington ” she says. “I just biked around campus with my friend  visiting the libraries Drumheller Fountain  andHusky Stadium.” Despite its challenges  the lockdown resulted in opportunities to think about travel in different ways. Whether they took solo trips  traveled locally with friends or their host families  or simply explored their own cities  our au pairs adapted to difficult circumstances while experiencing American culture. Want to learn more about the rare positive aspects of lockdown?

Tanya’s Tips: You Got Invited to a 4th of July BBQ! Here’s What to Expect!,From fireworks and parades to baseball games  picnics and beach trips – there are lots of ways to celebrate Independence Day in the U.S.! If you get an invite to a 4th of July barbecue – congratulations! Not only is this one of the best ways to join in the spirit of the holiday  it’s also a great occasion to meet new people! Curious what to expect? A common theme for the 4th of July celebrations is all about the colors of the U.S. flag: white signifies purity and innocence; red stands for hardiness and valor; and blue stands for vigilance  perseverance and justice. Philadelphia  Pennsylvania is known as the birthplace of American democracy and Independence. When in Philly  check out historic sites atIndependence National Historical Park  most are free for visitors to explore!  Americans are big fans of getting dressed in clothes with bold  patriotic colors  stars and stripes. You may also see people wearingUncle Samhats or getting dressed in colonial-themed costumes. Local stores like Walmart  CVS  Rite Aid  Walgreens  Party City and Old Navy usually have lots of options for those looking to dress up for Independence Day. Prices will be significantly reduced after July 4th so it’s a great moment to buy U.S.-themed souvenirs for friends and family back home! 😉 A typical appetizer at any barbecue  including July 4th  is a variety of chips and dips. Chip options include potato chips  corn chips  tortilla chips  vegetable chips  pita chips  plantain chips  crackers and others. Dips can be served cold or hot and can be purchased from a store or made from scratch. The etiquette around eating chips ‘n’ dips is quite strict – “no double dipping!” That is  dipping  taking a bite of the chip and then going back in for a second. To be mindful (and safe!) – take a spoonful of different types of dips on an individual plate  grab a few different types of chips  and indulge in all the tastes and flavors! Hot dogs and hamburgers are American barbecue staples. A typical way to “dress your dog” or a burger is with mustard and ketchup. Some people like to add mayonnaise  cheese  pickles and onions. There are no strict rules here: anything goes! There are different types of burger patties and hot dogs to accommodate one’s eating preferences: various types of meat  as well as vegetarian and vegan options. Don’t assume your barbecue host will have all of these options. It’s ok to ask what will be provided  and to bring the type you prefer to grill and eat  in case you have dietary restrictions. Another barbecue party-pleaser — and one of the most consumed foods on the 4th of July — is grilled corn on the cob. In the past  sweet corn was a staple food crop for Native Americans. Wonder which toppings taste good on grilled corn on the cob? Try butter  salt  pepper  and grated parmesan cheese. Some people also like it with garlic and mayo 🙂 Many cities and towns in the U.S.  big and small  host annual 4th of July fireworks shows. Often  these shows are kicked off with free live concerts. New York  Boston  Chicago  Dallas  Philadelphia  Washington D.C. – these are just a few of the big cities that compete for the honor of having the best 4th of July fireworks Consumer firework laws in the U.S. vary from state to state  even town to town. If consumer fireworks are used at a party you’re at  make sure to check your state and local regulations on how to use them (unless you live in a state where they are illegal!). Keep in mind that while fireworks can be fun  they are also dangerous and require caution. They are explosives and can cause fires and physical injury. So have fun and be safe! The goal of this game is to score points by throwing bean bags onto  or through the hole of the cornhole board opposite from you. This game is the most fun when played in teams! If you’re confused about the rules or how the score is calculated – just ask one of your American friends to explain. They will be happy and eager to! 😉 These are not your typical ice cream bars! These frozen pops are made from water  they taste sweet and fruity and will keep you fresh and cool after a full day of grilling and barbecuing. U.S. supermarkets sell these types of popsicles year-round. If you don’t get to try one on the 4th of July  enjoy it as a treat on any other day  especially when the sun is bright and the temperature is running high! S’more is a short version of the phrase ‘some more’. This treat is made from graham crackers (cookies)  marshmallows and chocolate! Typically a campfire treat  grilled s’mores could also be served at 4th of July celebrations. If you get to try one and you love it  don’t be shy to ask for s’more! It’s common to start 4th of July barbecue parties in the afternoon and enjoy the festivities all the way into the night. With lots of food to indulge in and special time spent with friends  old and new  your American Independence Day memories will last a lifetime! How are Independence Day celebrations in the U.S. different from your home country? What are the top 3 differences that stood out to you during this day? We’d love to hear from you!

The Importance of Pride Parades in the USA,June is LGTBQ+ Pride Month in the USA so you may be able to experience a Pride Parade in a city or town near you. American pride parades celebrate the history of the American LGBTQ+ rights movement. Although pride parades are loud  colorful  and fun  they reflect a LGBTQ+ history marked with obstacles and tragedy. Pride parades in the USA occur in late June to honor the history of theStonewall riots  a 1969 series of protests by New York’s LGBTQ+ community in response to discriminatory attacks by police. Au pairLucas  from Brazil  was in the USA for the 50th anniversary of Stonewall. “Honestly  I didn’t know much about our history before that ” says Lucas. “Being in the USA to witness this movement up close changed my whole perspective.” Learning about this history formed a whole different side to Lucas’s personality. “There was ‘Lucasbeforethe pride parades ’ and now there is ‘Lucasafterthe pride parades.’ This second version of me even created a drag queen character  named ‘Bianca Pose ’ to make my au pair community laugh and get through the tough times of the global pandemic.” Nowadays  au pairs find many parts of the USA to be LGBTQ+ friendly. “During my time as an au pair living in Baltimore ” says Lucas  “I was able to frequently travel to nearby New York City and Washington  D.C. There I was able to see how the USA embraced me as a gay man. I felt safe walking on the streets and freely wearing whatever clothing I felt like wearing. The way people parade their pride flags at their front doors  and even in front of churches  made me feel loved. I hope that one day Brazil can be like this.” Au pair Allan also compared the USA to his home country of Brazil: “In the USA  pride parades are really big – so much bigger than in Brazil. All of the support that comes from the art – music and cinema – helps a lot. I notice gay people being themselves  going out with their favorite costumes in the concerts of their favorite singers.” And it’s not just our au pair community that gets to support LGBTQ+ pride during their time in the USA! In 2017  Work & Travel USA participant Nasrene met drag performer – andRuPaul’s Drag Raceseason 11 contestant – Honey Davenport at New York City’s pride parade! If you’re at a pride parade in the USA  you’ll certainly see costumes  art  and music. You might even see a drag performer or two! Just remember that  for all their fun  pride parades reflect an important part of the American tradition of fighting for equality.

Being LGBTQ+ in the USA: Au Pairs’ Perspectives,What does acceptance mean to you? Au pairs come to the USA to introduce themselves to a new family and community. They hope to be accepted by both. Sexual orientation  gender identity  and gender expression are central to a person’s experience. The term “LGBTQ+” refers to people who are “lesbian  gay  bisexual  transsexual  questioning  and beyond.” Au Pair USA talked with former and current au pairs about their experiences with LGBTQ+ acceptance in the United States. Au pairs noted that LGBTQ+ people are treated differently around the world. Luisa observed that her home country  Mexico  is very religious: “I don’t think they are as inclusive as in the USA.” In comparison  one dutch au pair said that  in the Netherlands  the LGBTQ+ community is accepted more and more: “more people are willing to talk openly about LGBTQ+ issues.” There is a variety of lived experience between those two extremes. Three Brazilian au pairs – Josimar Lucas  and Allan – had a few anecdotes to share. Josimar noted that while his own experience coming out to friends and family was great  “from my perspective  crimes against LGBTQ+ communities are growing every day in Brazil.” Lucas and Allan had similar observations. “We have been fighting a lot in recent years to have better life conditions and rights ” says Lucas. “But many LGBTQ+ people die every year just because they are who they are.” “The transgender and the queer communities are more mistreated than the others  but we all suffer some kind of bullying throughout our lives ” says Allan. “In my hometown  many LGBTQ+ people don’t facephysicalaggression. However  physical and verbal aggression have the same emotional weight to me.” Luisa found that treatment of the LGBTQ+ community is different in the USA than what she was used to in Mexico. “My host family made their au pairs feel respected  like they belonged. They even asked which pronoun to use.” Josimar also found “huge support from [his] host family  the kids and even from people around the neighborhood.” With all of this support  our trio of Brazilian au pairs found that they grew on a personal level during their time in the USA. “I learned a lot about myself and the LGBT family ’ says Josimar. “I came to see that we are all humans  and we all have the right to love and start a family.” Allan “learned that I can really be myself living with another family  without hiding the things I love.” Similarly  Lucas learned “so many things about myself and my sexuality.” The goals of the au pair program are to exchange culture and provide excellent childcare. When LGBTQ+ au pairs feel supported to share themselves with their new community  they’re able to provide the best childcare possible. Luisa doesn’t identify as LGBTQ+ herself  but she was pleased to note that her host girl has made it clear that she believes that every person is the same no matter what. Josimar finished his time as an au pair years ago  but still keeps in contact with his host family. “They always supported my husband and I  and invited us to attend events as part of their family. My host kids see us like a couple  no different than a man and a woman  and have never disrespected us.” Finally  Lucas remembers that “my host mom told me that she wanted my host kid to be able to know all kinds of people  culture  and languages  in addition to individuals of different sexual orientations. I was able to be my full self around him. One thing that I always tried to teach him was to love every person just the way they are  I taught him that with songs and stories.” The fight for acceptance and equality for LGBTQ+ communities around the world is far from over. However  we’re pleased to report that many Americans view the opportunity to host an au pair that identifies as LGBTQ+ as an opportunity to bring new perspectives into their homes. In return  au pairs return to their home countries with an experience of being accepted by their host communities. What was your experience like as an LGTQ+ au pair in the USA?

Food is Cultural Exchange for Au Pairs and Families,Sharing food is a form of cultural exchange that is happening in everyhost familyhome. Even though the pandemic meant that we couldn’t eat in restaurants  au pairs and their hosts have been enjoying each other’s national cuisines at home. More than 90% of the au pairs we surveyed say they have found new American dishes that they like during their time in the States  while over 80% have tried  and enjoyed  other international foods. And over 75% of the au pairs even learned how to cook some American dishes themselves. For Alejandra  a Mexican au pair living in Philadelphia  cooking with her host family has been a mutually satisfying experience. She has enjoyed authentic American meals and her host family loves her Mexican food. Her host dad is a great cook and is “always in charge in the kitchen”. And while American hamburgers aren’t usually her favorite dish  she really enjoys his burgers  which are prepared with fresh ground beef  a tasty bun and “delicious condiments”. She also loves the famous Philly Cheesesteak (thin beefsteak and melted cheese in a sub roll) and the homemade tomato soup and grilled sandwiches. At the same time  she was surprised at the popularity of ‘fast’ frozen meals and canned food in the U.S. — “soup in a can  really?”. Thinking of her home country  she has missedbirria(a goat’s meat or beef stew) and good tacos! It was also difficult to adjust to eating bigger portions in the evenings. “Dinner is not the biggest meal of the day in Mexico  but now that I’ve been almost three months in the United States  I think I’m getting used to it ” she said. The first Mexican dish that she shared with her family wasasado mazatleco  a famous fried beef  potato and tomato sauce dish from Sinaloa  the region where she was born. While she doesn’t consider herself a good cook  her host family were thrilled! She also madetostadas de pollo— crispy flat tortillas piled with shredded chicken and toppings like lettuce  tomatoes  avocado  andcrema mexicana. “They were very surprised about all the colors on the plate ” she says. Elena like many au pairs  was impressed at the variety of the food available in the States. “I am amazed how you can find any kind of food you want  even if  sometimes  it doesn’t reflect the true food from that country ” she said  referring to the long history of immigration to the USA and its multiple cultures. Elena  from Italy  has tried Chinese  Indian  Colombian  and Mexican food while in the USA. An American dish that she especially enjoyed is Jambalaya (a West African  French and Spanish influenced dish of sausage  rice and vegetables popular in the south). Other classics she has tried include Hushpuppies (deep-fried nuggets made from cornmeal  flour  eggs and buttermilk) and the ever-popular as Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches  and S’Mores (marshmallows roasted over a fire  on top of chocolate  between and two graham crackers). The kids can be picky with new foods  but she has cooked Italian food for her host family  and says they really enjoy it. She has made home-made pasta  ravioli  and pizza — she cannot find any ‘good’ pizza in the States. She’s also preparedfocaccia(a white pizza-bread)  andbruschette(toasted bread rubbed with garlic and topped with tomatoes and basil). Her cakes were also very popular! She tried but doesn’t like ranch dressing (a buttermilk based dressing with herbs)  which she thinks “covers the real taste of the food.” But what will Elena remember most fondly? “I will miss the usual American breakfast — bacon and eggs  and also some sweets such as Reese’s [a peanut butter filled chocolate] and all different kinds of M&M’s!” For au pairs in the USA and their American host families  cooking and eating food together really is part of this great cultural exchange program.

Super Au Pair Maureen Looks to the Future,You may have heard the term “origin story.” Superheroes have them; it describes how they got their powers. Maureen was our 2020 Super Au Pair  and her origin story begins in Germany. Maureen practices boxing and yoga  but her superpowers aren’t physical; they come from her heart. In 2018 in Germany  Maureen began working with youth with special needs at a school for physically and mentally disabled children. Prior to this  in 2017  she worked at a camp that integrated disabled and non-disabled kids. “I fell in love with caring for children ” she said. “But I also wanted to experience something new  so I started looking at being an au pair in North America.” Her curiosity led her to apply to Au Pair USA. “It was the perfect opportunity for me ” she said. “I was able to combine my love for childcare with a curiosity to discover something new – to see and live in a whole new world and culture.” During the matching process  she interviewed  with a family with a teenage boy with special needs  and she felt a connection: “I knew they were the right family for me ” she said. For the next 18 months  she was that family’s au pair. “I developed my skills in patience  communication  and empathy ” she said. These skills  as described to us by her host family in a heartfelt video  led Au Pair USA  tochoose her as our 2020 Super Au Pair(in addition to becoming asecond place runner-upfor the International Au Pair Association Au Pair of the Year Award!) Maureen is now going home to apply everything she learned in the marketing field. Maureen observes that communication and empathy are key parts of authentic marketing. Her time as an au pair was great preparation. Maureen’s advice to current and future au pairs: “Try to connect with your host children and family. Teach them something they didn’t know. And be persistent.” One of Maureen’s proudest moments was teaching Alex to tie his shoes. “The family had tried and tried  but gave up ” she said. “I tried with a fresh approach and succeeded where no one else had.” Responsibility is another “super” trait. When Maureen arrives home  she isn’t going straight to reunite with friends and family; she’s quarantining for two weeks. Then  and only then  will she do something she’s been looking forward to for almost two years: eating a big plate of her dad’s home-cooked spaghetti!

Au Pairs and Host Families Learn from Each Other’s Religious Traditions,“What if my host family has a different religion than my own?” This may be a concern as you consider becoming an au pair. However  learning is part of cultural exchange. You should embrace all aspects of a new culture. This includes different religious traditions. Au pair Bianca  from Brazil  is Christian  but joined a Jewish host family. Her host mom Hannah had been part of an interfaith club in high school. She was excited to share and learn with her au pair. Hannah started by introducing Bianca to food from Jewish culture. “Food is a way that people connect ” she explains. Bianca most enjoyedchallah  a special bread served during holidays (other than Passover  when leavened bread is traditionally not eaten). Bianca’s mother  a pastry chef in Brazil  is “eager to make challah when I return home ” Bianca says. Hannah also introduced Bianca to stories behind the Jewish holidays. Bianca found Hanukkah especially fascinating. During her time with her host family  Bianca became more involved in the Jewish community. She started using Hebrew expressions  such asmitzvah(a good deed) and began joining the family for Shabbat  the Saturday day of rest. Karely  from Mexico  also discovered new traditions as an au pair. Her host family taught her about Hindu holidays practiced in India. Host mom Shraddha always includes Karely  a Catholic  in these celebrations. Holi  for example  is a festival celebrating spring and new beginnings. In 2020  because of COVID-19  Karely celebrated in the family’s backyard. Karely also celebrated Diwali  Hindu’s festival of lights. Shraddha describes it as “New Year and Christmas combined into one.” Diwali consists of five days of celebration. Karely helped her host kids craft traditional lamps calleddiya  which represent victory of light over darkness. Karely received a personal gift that day. Shraddha gave her a necklace with an “Om” symbol. This is an important Hindu image representing a spiritual sound. Hannahis happy for her three kids to broaden their experiences beyond their Jewish school and community. In contrast  Shraddha wanted her children to discover aspects of their Indian heritage that she herself did not experience  as her parents were immigrants who sought to assimilate to American culture. In both cases  the host families’ religious traditions were an exciting aspect of cultural exchange for au pairs. “Au pairs’ relationships with their host families are based on trust and openness ” notes Hannah. “Just as trust and openness is important in interactions between religion.” Matt Wallace was previously the Community & Digital Content Manager for the InterExchange Marketing team.

Winter Holiday Traditions You Might Not Know About,Ah  the holidays. No matter how bad your year has been – and 2020 has been challenging for most of us – you can always hope that the end-of-year holidays cheer you up! You may be familiar with traditional holidays such as Hanukkah  Christmas  and Kwanzaa. But these holidays have some traditions that are unique  interesting  or not widely known. Read on to discover these  and a few lesser-known holidays as well! Many Americans associate wintertime with several family-oriented holidays  each with its own unique traditions and food. Three holidays are particularly significant in the USA: Hanukkah  Christmas  and Kwanzaa.Interestingly  countdown calendars may be given to both children and adults during all three of these holidays. While these started as a Christmas tradition for advent  these countdown calendars can be found for Hanukkah and Kwanzaa too. Think of a three dimensional calendar  with each date being a box that you open on that date. Inside is a small gift  such as a piece of candy. Au pair Karlalovedadvent calendars. “We don’t have a tradition like that in Brazil ” she says. “It’s definitely something I’ll pass forward when I have my own kids.” Au pair Maureen also introduced advent calendars to her host kid  with great success! Hanukkah is celebrated by Jewish people all over the world. However   even many Americans are unaware of some of Hanukkah’s traditions. Interesting Hanukkah traditions includegeltanddreidels. Gelt are chocolate coins wagered by players (often children) who spin the dreidel as seen below. When the dreidel stops spinning  the symbols on its four sides dictate who wins and loses coins. Learn more about therules of the game here! There are many different traditions associated with Christmas. You’ve probably already noticed that Americans love to decorate their houses with bright lights and candles in the windows.  And throughout December  you’ll also find Christmas music inescapable.Listen toourplaylist here!) There are also some newer  sillier Christmas traditions. The Elf on the Shelf is a popular stuffed toy who keeps a watchful eye on children and reports back to Santa. Parents enjoy hiding him throughout the house to compel their children to be good  or risk a bad report to Santa. And although Elf on the Shelf is a recent phenomenon based on a 2005 book  its popularity is booming. In addition to being featured in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade  the little elf iseverywhere.When we asked InterExchange participants about the strangest holiday traditions they noticed in the USA  most pointed to Elf on the Shelf. Why? Becausehe’s always watching you. Some Christmas traditions  like Elf on the Shelf  may seem strange. Others are simply not as commonly known. When we asked au pairs which holiday traditions they introduced to  their host kids  Saint Nicholas Day (also spelled Nikolas and Nikolaus) was the most frequent response. Au pairs Maureen and Anna were amazed to learn that their host kids had never heard of it. Saint Nicholas Day is celebrated on December 5th or 6th in Western Christian countries (including Germany  the Netherlands  Austria  and Poland  countries from which many Au Pair USA au pairs come). First  children leave their shoes in a prominent place before going to bed. Then Saint Nicholas  the origin of the USA’s Santa Claus and Britain’s Father Christmas  would – as parents tell their children – visit after bedtime to fill the shoes with treats. Another relatively recent American tradition is the “ugly sweater party” which  as the name implies  are gatherings where people intentionally wear colorful and silly holiday sweaters. This tradition began as a parody of the Christmas sweaters worn in twentieth century America. Now it’s spread to gatherings of friends  family  and even coworkers. Sticking with the sweets theme  the Christmas tradition that au pair Jenni has most enjoyed is decorating cookies with her host family on Christmas Eve. She commented that  although she’s certainly made cookies in the past  there’s something special about doing so the night before Christmas with kids who have been anticipating that day all year! Kwanzaa is a weeklong celebration held in the United States that honors African heritage in African-American culture. Kwanzaa is observed from December 26th to January 1st  and culminates in gift giving and a big feast. Dr. Maulana Karenga  professor and chairman of Africana Studies at California State University  created Kwanzaa in 1966 in response to the previous year’sWatts Riotsin Los Angeles as a way to bring African-Americans together as a community. Dr. Karenga researched African harvest celebrations and combined aspects of several different celebrations  such as those of the Ashanti and those of the Zulu  to form the foundation of Kwanzaa. Several of these aspects are visible in the picture below  including a “kinara” (candleholder)  seven ceremonial candles to symbolically re-create the sun’s power  and the colors green  red  and black  inspired by the flag of Ethiopia and used to represent Pan-Africanist ideology. You canread much more about Kwanzaa here! And  finally  we’ve arrived at the end of the year. New Year’s Eve is marked by many traditions in the USA  many of which involve partying. In New York City  thousands of people (many of them tourists) gather in Times Square to watch an ornamented sphere descend a pole on the roof of a tall building; it reaches the bottom as the new year arrives. Meanwhile  across the country  people pop bottles of champagne at midnight. New Year’s traditions vary around the world  but often have one theme in common: hope. In Brazil  wearing underwear of certain colors is thought to have fortuitous results: red brings love and yellow  money. Colombia’s traditions are especially fitting for a (hopefully) post-lockdown world: locals are known to carry empty suitcases around in hopes that the new year brings travel. As 2020 wraps up  people will be especially hopeful for a 2021 with more joy than the previous year. While one can expect plenty of popping bottles  we hope the gatherings will be socially-distanced. Here’s to 2021! 🥂 Matt Wallace was previously the Community & Digital Content Manager for the InterExchange Marketing team.

Lockdown Strengthens Host Family and Au Pair Relationships,The term “au pair” is French  meaning “at par” or “equal ” indicating that the au pair is intended to be treated as a family member. Au Pair USA believes that this is the true spirit of the au pair program. This perspective has been especially important during the COVID-19 crisis  as stay-at-home orders have affected family members equally and required that everyone spend more time together in their “bubble” than they may have expected. We’ve been checking in with our participants to see how things are going and are glad to hearheart-warming storiesof how this time  though challenging  has actually deepened their relationships with their host families. Jacqueline  an Australian au pair living in Maryland tells us: “While both of my host parents worked throughout lockdown  we still ended up with a lot more time to spend together as we were unable to leave the house! In the very beginning  the six of us (grandmother Donna and the kids included) would take car trips on the weekend and head out to drive-through Starbucks or Dunkin’ Donuts and play a few Pokémon Go Battles – the kids are obsessed with Pokémon Go! Being home with both kids the whole day definitely strengthened our relationship  helped them understand my role and responsibility towards them  and improved their attachment to me. I think they now see me as less of a “babysitter” and more as part of the family.” Jacqueline goes on to say  “Lockdown also allowed me to REALLY bond with Donna and my host mom Maria. Every Saturday night during lockdown  we made a point of having a ladies’ night and heading down to Donna’s space to watch a movie. It was always really lovely to have that time where none of us were responsible for the children  and we could just focus on enjoying each other’s company. Overall  the lockdown was really a blessing in disguise as it pushed us to form stronger bonds fairly quickly! I’m so grateful for such a wonderful host family!” It’s not just the Au Pair USA au pairs who are benefiting from this extra bonding time. Host families  too  are forming lifelong friendships with their au pairs. Host mom Mallory in Georgia shared this about her au pair: “Johandri has changed our life! She is so much more than childcare help; she has literally become my little sister. The thought of her leaving already makes me sad  as I can’t imagine daily life without her here! She is kind  patient  and fun. She is organized  and she has completely become culturally submerged (open to trying everything). Our children adore her. We adore her. We are so thankful for this incredible program for giving our paths the opportunity to cross! She will be a part of our lives forever  and I cannot wait to see what the next 1.5 years will bring!” It is clear that COVID-19 has brought new challenges to families and au pairs alike. However  it is clear that our host families and au pairs are able to find a silver lining to this difficult time. While this was not the experience families or au pairs were expecting  they’ve been able to use the time to develop deep and meaningful relationships and learn to be truly “on par” with one another. Mary Beth was the InterExchange Au Pair USA Local Coordinator for the Chapel Hill area from 2010 to 2021. During that time  she contributed to many Au Pair USA blog posts.

“Hagen’s Epic Road Trip Playlist”,Nine U.S. states in nine days? That’s what German au pair Hagen accomplished. His time with his host family was coming to an end  and Hagen wanted to ensure his replacement arrived safe and sound. So  instead of new au pair Fernanda (Ferfor short) taking a few extra flights (and increasing the risk of COVID-19 exposure)  Hagen drove from his host family’s home in Washington state and met Fer at the airport in Arizona. The two then took an epic road trip back to their host family. How big of a distanceisnine states? It’s difficult to get a sense of a country’s size from maps. The USA is huge! While not as big as Russia  it’s about the same size as Canada  slightly bigger than China  and over a million square kilometers larger than Brazil. From one end to the other  it’s about as wide as Australia. You could drive from Spain to Russia quicker than from between America’s two coasts. With all that space  there’s a lot to see. And for all that distance  you’d need some music to pass the time. For these reasons  as we recount Hagen’s road trip  we’re going to include his own recommendations for things to see  and music from his playlist which accompanied the journey. Day one was a breeze: Hagen started in Washington state  seen in the upper left of the map below  and drove south to Oregon. As his journey was just beginning  the first song on his road trip playlist was  fittingly Avicii’s “Wake Me Up.” Day two started in Grants Pass  Oregon and finished in Ukiah  California. Along the way he saw Redwood National Park  observing that “I never thought trees could be that tall… it was mind blowing!” Hagen was blinded by the beautiful nature – “it’s so pretty ” he says. As such “Blinding Lights” by The Weekndwas on full blast. Day three included a stop at the Golden Gate Bridge View Vista Point. Hagen adored it: “That’s the most beautiful bridge in the world!” So what was on Hagen’s San Francisco playlist?Harry Styles – “Adore You.” On the fourth day  Hagen took a pit stop in Los Angeles  observing that “traveling while there is a global pandemic is strange; L.A. was a ghost town!” Day four ended in Santa Cruz  California  where the Pacific inspired the song of the day:“Ocean & You” by Diviners. On the fifth day  he finally made it to Phoenix  Arizona to pick up au pair Fer at the airport for the trip back to Washington state. They were excited for their trip and runninghigh on emotion. Consequently that was the song of day five. On day six  the pair drove north and saw three states in a single day. Highlights included the Las Vegas Strip of Las Vegas  Nevada. At just 19 years old  Hagen wasn’t overly impressed with Sin City’s recreational options. (“Do not travel to Vegas if you’re under 21 years old ” he says. “It’s boring.”) They also saw Zion National Park and the Hoover Dam. “I don’t think Zion is as famous as Yellowstone  but it should be!” said Hagen. As they were following the sunset  the song of the day was – you guessed it – “Following the Sun” by SUPER-Hi x Neeka. Nearing the end of their journey home  Hagen and Fer spent the seventh day in Utah  and took in the sites of Salt Lake City  including the downtown area and the Utah State Capitol Building. Given the weather and the architectural theme of the day  they listened to“Light Blue Skies” by We Architects. On day eight Hagen and Fer drifted between the states of Idaho and Wyoming. On the way they saw Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone National Park. Of the latter  Hagen exclaims  “it’s a volcano!” Sticking with the theme “On Fire” by DISTURBwas the song of the day. The final day consisted of a trek from Mullan  Idaho back to the host family’s home in Seattle  Washington. Hagen and Fer were tired  but not too tired to hit “play” on the final songs in their road trip playlist. They were on their way home  and fittingly their playlist included“On My Way ” by Alan Walker  Sabrina Carpenter & Farruko. Exploring new cultures? Adapting to challenges in a new country? This is exactly what the Au Pair Program is all about! Want to hear Hagen’s full playlist? Check it out below! And then read why Hagen deserved to beour 2019 Au Pair of the Year!

Understanding the Presidential Election,Election day is November 3rd  2020. This year  American voters will choose either the Republican  Donald Trump  or the Democrat  Joe Biden  to be the President of the United States of America for the next four years. The system that we use to elect the president is a little confusing because the winner is not simply the person who receives the most votes nationwide. For example  in 2016 Hillary Clinton received more votes nationwide than Donald Trump did  yet he still won the election. The winner of the presidential election is the person who gets the mostElectoral Collegevotes. Let’s try to make this a little less confusing… Each U.S. state has a certain number of Electoral College votes  which we can think of as “points” for simplicity. This number of points is generally proportional to the state’s population  with more populous states having more Electoral College points than less populated ones. However  all states have at least three Electoral College votes regardless of population. You can find a list of the number of points for each statehere. After Americans vote  one of the candidates will be declared the winner of each state and will collect all of that state’s Electoral College points. For example  it is likely that more people in California will vote for Joe Biden  so he will likely win California and collect all of their 55 Electoral College points. In Texas  more people will likely vote for Donald Trump  so he will be the winner of Texas  and will collect Texas’s 38 Electoral College points. This will happen in each of the 50 states until all of the country’s 538 available points are assigned to one of the candidates. The winner of the election will be the candidate who wins 270 or more points. The winner will be “sworn in” as president on January 20   2021. Most Americans take pride in voting  considering it a civic duty. Moreover  Twitter and social media have increased peoples’ awareness of political issues  and you are likely to see a dramatic increase in political advocacy on these platforms as the election approaches. Although the political discourse you observe on social media might appear a bit hostile  Americans are often reluctant to discuss politics in person. Doing so may be considered impolite  even in families where generations have drastically different political views. It’s a strange quirk of American culture that one could post an angry tweet denouncing the other political party  before joining family or friends belonging to that party for dinner. But then again  all countries have their quirks  right? Want to learn more about the USA? Sticking with a political theme here’s a bit more about the U.S. holiday “President’s Day.” Or perhaps you’d like a break from politics altogether. In that case  read more about something thatmost Americans share: a love for dogs! Matt Wallace was previously the Community & Digital Content Manager for the InterExchange Marketing team.
